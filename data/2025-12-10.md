Abstract: The expansion of commercial launch capabilities has significantly increased opportunities for interplanetary small satellite (SmallSat) missions. As researchers plan for more missions beyond Earth, there is a demand for accessible tools that help better predict and understand the thermal effects on their spacecraft in orbital environments around Earth and other bodies. While commercial thermal analysis tools offer high-fidelity modeling capabilities and results, they are often expensive and require extensive training to be used effectively. This paper details a framework for a user-friendly Satellite Thermal Model (SATMO) to support the early stages of space mission planning for CubeSats orbiting Earth and other Solar System bodies. SATMO is an open-source, MATLAB-based, six-node thermal analysis program designed for satellites in low-altitude circular orbits. Although SATMO requires a MATLAB license -- typically inexpensive or institutionally provided in academic settings -- it remains substantially more accessible than professional thermal analysis software. SATMO requires an internet connection for some features but does not rely on additional MATLAB toolboxes. The SATMO modeling approach is validated with the space industry standard Thermal Desktop software, with temperatures comparable to within 1.17$^\circ$C for a 10 cm $\times$ 10 cm $\times$ 10 cm CubeSat in various configurations, orbiting around primary bodies including Earth, Venus, and Mars. An example use case of SATMO is presented with a Mars-orbiting CubeSat to demonstrate its functionalities and the outputs available to users. SATMO offers increased accessibility to satellite thermal modeling for the research community, enabling quick thermal trade studies and interplanetary mission plans.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Interstellar objects such as 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov offer a unique window into the formation and evolution of other star systems, yet the tracking and analysis of their trajectories remain limited to specialized research institutions. Existing interstellar and solar system datasets are large, complex, and difficult to navigate, reducing accessibility for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts. To address this, we present The Interstellar Signature: a computational framework for open-source interstellar tracking, implemented through a web-based platform.
  Interstellar Signature bridges raw astronomical data and an intuitive, developer-friendly interface. The framework integrates live data streams from public repositories and APIs with physics-based simulation methods to model and visualize the motion of interstellar and solar system objects in real time. The platform supports interactive visualizations, comparative orbital analysis, and modular tools that allow users to explore and extend the system for research, experimentation, or development.
  As an open-source project, the framework encourages collaboration and hands-on engagement with complex datasets. It exists within NexusCosmos, an ecosystem envisioned as a "Linux for the space race," aimed at democratizing access to space science tools and data. By transforming large datasets into visual, interactive, and customizable simulations, Interstellar Signature expands participation in interstellar research and observation.
  Future extensions will add AI-driven trajectory prediction, anomaly detection, and advanced visualization. By combining open-source accessibility with computational rigor, this framework lowers the barrier to interstellar analysis and serves as a step toward bridging professional astronomy and public scientific engagement.

Abstract: We investigate the microlensing detectability of extraterrestrial technosignatures originating from Dyson sphere \textendash like structures, such as Dyson Swarms surrounding primordial black holes (PBHs). These hypothetical swarms consist of stochastically varying, partially opaque structures that could modulate standard microlensing light curves through time-dependent transmission effects. We introduce a probabilistic framework that includes a stochastic transmission model governed by variable optical depth and random gap distributions. We perform a parameter scan and generate heatmaps of the optical transit duration. We study the infrared excess radiation and peak emission wavelength as complementary observational signatures. Additionally, we define and analyze the effective optical depth and the anomalous microlensing event rate for these stochastic structures. Our findings provide a new avenue for searching for extraterrestrial advanced civilizations by extending microlensing studies to include artificial, dynamic modulation signatures.

Abstract: The Roman Coronagraph's capabilities in the faint star, small IWA limit has enormous scientific (programmatic) impacts. Testing its performance in this limit provides a first look at challenges that may be encountered with the Habitable Worlds Observatory in imaging rocky planets around the nearest K and M stars. We propose such a rigorous test with the HLC/575nm targeting a newly-discovered superjovian planet HIP 54515 b, whose predicted contrast is $\sim$4.7 $\times$10$^{-8}$--2.5 $\times$10$^{-7}$. The companion lies close to the coronagraph IWA (well interior to the TTR5 performance region) and orbits a V = 6.8 star, near the limit for which the coronagraph may yield deep contrasts. Multiple reference stars are available that will further test CGI's performance as a function of $Δ$ pitch angle to assess how the telescope's thermal environment impacts contrasts.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Conventional ground-based optical telescopes, even those with large apertures, primarily observe stars, close binaries, and multiple systems as unresolved point sources through photometric measurements. Spectroscopy can identify multiple stellar components within a system, but both techniques are fundamentally limited in resolving stellar surfaces and providing direct angular separations. Although photometric and spectroscopic observations yield critical information on magnitudes/flux, metallicities, and orbital properties, complementary high-angular-resolution methods are required to constrain additional system characteristics, including angular orbital parameters, model-independent distances, radii, and stellar masses. The limitations of these two methods arise due to the Diffraction Limit of the telescopes and atmospheric turbulence. Speckle Interferometry (SI) is a clever and affordable method for ground-based telescopes to work around atmospheric turbulence. In this work, we utilize the speckle images obtained by the 3.6 m DOT and demonstrate the capability of SI to resolve binary systems, measure their orbital separations, and determine their position angles. For systems with faint companions where conventional analysis fails, we employ Bayesian inference to model speckle patterns and estimate orbital parameters with high precision. These results establish the effective methodology for using a medium-sized, 4-m class telescope like the DOT as a high-resolution stellar interferometer and demonstrate the potential of speckle interferometry as a powerful technique to advance optical interferometric studies within Indian astronomy.

Abstract: We present PolySwyft, a novel, non-amortised simulation-based inference framework that unites the strengths of nested sampling (NS) and neural ratio estimation (NRE) to tackle challenging posterior distributions when the likelihood is intractable but a forward simulator is available. By nesting rounds of NRE within the exploration of NS, and employing a principled KL-divergence criterion to adaptively terminate sampling, PolySwyft achieves faster convergence on complex, multimodal targets while rigorously preserving Bayesian validity. On a suite of toy problems with analytically known posteriors of a dim(theta,D)=(5,100) multivariate Gaussian and multivariate correlated Gaussian mixture model, we demonstrate that PolySwyft recovers all modes and credible regions with fewer simulator calls than swyft's TNRE. As a real-world application, we infer cosmological parameters dim(theta,D)=(6,111) from CMB power spectra using CosmoPower. PolySwyft is released as open-source software, offering a flexible toolkit for efficient, accurate inference across the astrophysical sciences and beyond.

Abstract: The focal plane assembly of wavefront camera is the key imaging device of wavefront detection camera and the key load of the exoplanet imaging coronagraph module. In order to ensure the imaging quality and reduce the dark current and thermal noise, it is necessary to effectively dissipate the heat of the focal plane CCD and other high-power electronic devices to ensure the working performance and reliability of the focal plane assembly. Based on the limited space and cooling resources, this paper adopts the flexible graphene heat conducting cable and grooved heat pipes, and carries out detailed thermal design and thermal analysis of its cooling path. The finite element model is established by thermal analysis software and thermal simulation is carried out. in that steady state, the work temperature range of the CCD chip is -12.8 to -10.9 celsius, which meets the temperature control index, and the work temperatures of other components are also within the design requirements, which indicate that the thermal design scheme is reasonable and feasible, and meets the task requirements.

Abstract: The Dark Ages (DA) provides a crucial window into the physics of the infant Universe, with the 21-cm signal offering the only direct probe for mapping out the three-dimensional distribution of matter at this epoch. To measure this cosmological signal, the Dark-ages EXplorer (DEX) has been proposed as a compact, grid-based radio array on the lunar farside. The minimal design consists of a 32 $\times$ 32 array of 3-m dipole antennas, operating in the $7 - 50$ MHz band. A practical challenge on the lunar surface is that the antennas may get displaced from their intended positions due to deployment imprecisions and non-coplanarity arising from local surface undulations. We present, for the first time, an end-to-end simulation pipeline, called SPADE-21cm, that integrates a sky model with a DA 21-cm signal model simulated in the lunar frame and incorporating lunar topography data. We study the effects of both lateral (xy) and vertical (z) offsets on the two-dimensional power spectra across the $7 - 12$ MHz and $30 - 35$ MHz spectral windows, with tolerance thresholds derived only for the latter. Our results show that positional offsets bias the power spectrum by $10 - 30$ per cent relative to the expected 21-cm power spectrum during DA. Lateral offsets within $σ_{xy}/λ\lesssim 0.027$ (at 32.5 MHz) keep the fraction of Fourier modes with strong contamination (> 50 per cent of the signal) to less than 1 per cent, whereas vertical height offsets affect a larger fraction. This conclusion holds for the 21-cm window with $k_\parallel > 0.5$ $h$ cMpc$^{-1}$ over the range of $k_\perp = 0.003 - 0.009$ $h$ cMpc$^{-1}$.

Abstract: Cosmic strings attached to rotating black holes extract its rotational energy, resulting in a mass loss and reduced spin. In this paper we discuss the proposed methods to detect these phenomena and present a novel methodology based on existing literature, by considering a Low Mass X-ray binary system. We investigate the impact of a cosmic string interacting with a black hole in an X-ray binary system and attempt to explain the observations of unexpected orbital period changes in such systems by proposing mass loss by cosmic strings to be a potential cause. For a period change of order $10^{-10}$, the string tension is $\sim 10^{-17}$, lying in the predicted range for cosmic string tension. An analysis of multiple low mass X-ray binary systems is carried out and it is shown that a significant and observable change occurs for a string tension $\sim 10^{-11}$.

Abstract: We investigate the constraints imposed by the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) on gravitational lensing in gravity's rainbow, focusing in particular on scenarios beyond extremality and on the interplay between the WGC and the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) in the context of Reissner-Nordström-Anti-de Sitter black holes modified by rainbow gravity. Using topological methods, we first analyze the configuration of photon spheres and confirm that unstable circular photon spheres with topological charge $(ω= -1)$ exist outside the event horizon throughout the parameter space, thereby verifying the simultaneous validity of both the WGC and the WCCC. The rainbow functions $f(\varepsilon)$ and $g(\varepsilon)$, which encode Planck-scale corrections through the energy ratio $(\varepsilon =E/E_P)$, modify both the spacetime metric and the extremality bound. We derive the corresponding modified extremal charge-to-mass ratio, $(q^2/m^2)>(Q^2/M^2)_{\text{ext}}$, and show that gravity's rainbow offers a natural mechanism for reconciling these two fundamental conjectures. By applying the Gauss-Bonnet theorem in conjunction with Jacobi-Maupertuis optical geometry, we compute the weak deflection angles for both photons and massive particles to second order. The rainbow function $g(\varepsilon)$ appears with powers $(g^{-2})$ and $(g^{-4})$, enhancing the deflection angle when $g(\varepsilon)<1$, while $f(\varepsilon)$ influences only the charge-dependent contributions. At extremality, the deflection angle becomes independent of $f(\varepsilon)$, yielding a universal prediction that can be tested without specifying the form of the rainbow functions. We further find that super-extremal configurations exhibit stronger lensing effects than extremal black holes, suggesting a potential observational discriminator between WGC-satisfying naked singularities and WCCC-preserving black holes.

Abstract: Perturbative calculations of gravitational radiation near horizons of rotating black holes have been plagued with divergence issues. We derive for the first time a divergence-free source term for such cases within the generalized Sasaki-Nakamura formalism. As applications, we compute the dynamical deformation of the event horizon caused by an ultrarelativistic particle plunge, demonstrating the excitation of quasinormal modes at the horizon, and we evaluate the energy flux towards the horizon from an extreme mass-ratio inspiral. This framework provides a powerful tool for studying physics near black hole horizons.

Abstract: The remnant of a black hole binary merger settles into a stationary configuration by "ringing down" through the emission of gravitational waves that consist of a superposition of damped exponentials with discrete complex frequencies - the remnant black hole's quasinormal modes. While the frequencies themselves depend solely on the mass and spin of the remnant, the mode amplitudes depend on the merger dynamics. We investigate quasinormal mode excitation by a point particle plunging from the innermost stable circular orbit of a Kerr black hole. Our formalism is general, but we focus on computing the quasinormal mode excitation coefficients in the frequency domain for equatorial orbits, and we analyze their dependence on the remnant black hole spin. We find that higher overtones and subdominant multipoles of the radiation become increasingly significant for rapidly rotating black holes. This suggests that the prospects for detecting overtones and higher-order modes are considerably enhanced for highly spinning merger remnants.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: An inflationary model can be constrained by non-gaussian statistics as a parameter in the LSS (Large Scale Structure) distribution, and in the radiation of CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) fluctuating temperature. Data on the CMB from Planck Collaboration provide up-to-date constraints on the parameters controlling the degree of non-Gaussianity in certain inflationary models, thus supporting or not supporting the model. Setting the non-Gaussianity parameter investigated in this study can be a reference whether or not it is a good parameter in constraining cosmological inflation models. This study attempts to examine the non-Gaussianity of the 3+1-dimensional 4DEGB gravitational cosmological inflation model starting from random field statistics. The non-Gaussian signature generated by the model is quantified, and the parameters controlling the degree of non-Gaussianity are constrained using data observation of Planck Collaboration. The method used in investigating non-Gaussianity is the in-in formalism, applied after obtaining the 3-point of $ζ$ (curvature perturbation) terms of the perturbation expansion to the third order. The 3-point correlation function helps to create a bispectrum used to investigate the non-gaussinity of the inflation model. The results of this study show that the model tested is the slow roll pressed in the squeezed limit, because it witnesses a dominant local shape function. It has such as the non-gaussianity possessed by the single scalar field inflation as confirmation that Gauss-Bonnet term within Einstein-Hilbert action is topologically invariant, and no influence gravitational field equations in $D<5$ spacetimes.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We develop a mesoscopic framework in which the cosmological exterior is treated as an open quantum subsystem coupled to a horizon reservoir. Local conservation laws, expressed as $\nabla_μ\langle J^μ\rangle=0$, imply that when baryon number is lost across a horizon its conserved quantum numbers are sequestered into inaccessible modes, producing an effective depletion in the exterior sector. Global unitarity therefore requires compensating source terms in the exterior continuity equations. We show that relativity forces these compensating excitations to arise through long-wavelength geometric modes: only infrared fluctuations can restore entropy and charge while remaining outside the causal wedge of the infalling matter. This identifies an infrared return channel as a generic feature of horizon-coupled semiclassical gravity.
  The second ingredient is a Carnot-Carathéodory (CC) tangent geometry, whose mesoscopic scale $σ$ governs both the excitation of these IR modes and the kinematics of photon and matter propagation. In this setting, photon trajectories follow recurrent horizontal geodesics, producing an effective cosmic cavity whose stationary state is a Planck spectrum set by $σ$. The same scale modifies large-radius circular motions in a way consistent with flattened rotation curves. Horizon thermodynamics and mesoscopic balance laws then link $σ$ to the cosmic expansion rate, $H\simσ$, yielding a unified infrared structure underlying photon equilibrium, baryon balance, and large-scale kinematics.

Abstract: We present new spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations in a quasi-stationary approximation that describe self-gravitating scalar field configurations around a black hole, including angular momentum number $\ell$. An approach analogous to the one which gives rise to $\ell$-boson stars is used here to construct self-gravitating ``gravitational atoms" with $\ell\ge0$. We refer to these new solutions as {\it noble gravitational atoms}, by analogy with noble atoms, which are characterized by closed electron shells. We show that, in the proper limit, noble gravitational atoms approach $\ell$-boson stars globally, displaying noticeable differences only in a region very close to the event horizon. Noble gravitational atoms with $\ell>0$ sometimes present density maxima located at relatively large radii, with small density close to the horizon for $\ell>1$. Furthermore, they do not always present the typical density spike at the event horizon if $\ell > 0$; on the contrary, they sometimes exhibit a small dip there. When $\ell=0$, a spike can appear, but its contribution to the total mass density is always negligible. The size, density, and lifetime of these objects vary significantly depending on the parameters, being in some cases as large as galaxies, as dilute as dark matter, and as long-lived as the Universe itself.

Abstract: Overtones are known to improve the performance of fits to the ringdown, both in numerical-relativity simulations and gravitational-wave observations. Although the overtone frequencies are a concrete prediction of general relativity, it remains an open question whether they are excited to the extent that fits would suggest. In this work, we take a pragmatic approach and investigate the practical utility of each additional overtone in extracting information from the ringdown. We look at the dependence of the ringdown start time on the number of overtones, and the feasibility of detecting deviations from general relativity in the ringdown frequencies. We suggest that there is no clear "maximum" overtone, but rather the utility of each additional overtone decreases compared to the one before. Finally, we perform Bayesian parameter estimation (as opposed to least-squares fits) to obtain posterior distributions on the overtone amplitudes and phases, allowing us to investigate their correlation structure. Due to strong correlations it becomes increasingly hard to measure individual amplitudes and phases for the highest overtones. However, we find that the joint measurement of overtone amplitudes (i.e., the correlation structure itself) is sensitive to the frequencies and decay times of even the highest overtones, possibly offering an avenue to perform consistency tests with general relativity.

Abstract: Black holes (BHs) in magnetized environments are a topic of intense research, both theoretical and observational. In particular, the interaction between charged matter and such objects provides a rich arena with applications ranging from fundamental field theory to high-energy astrophysics. In this work, we investigate the linear stability of a magnetized Einstein-Maxwell solution describing a static, axially symmetric BH immersed in a uniform magnetic field. We probe the dynamics of an external charged scalar field through its quasinormal modes (QNMs), combining frequency- and time-domain analyses. We find a critical value of the field charge at which the QNM spectrum exhibits universal power-law scaling with an exponent of approximately $1/2$. This critical behavior admits a simple interpretation in terms of a transition between a confined regime, where waves remain effectively trapped within a region of characteristic size $\sim 1/B$, and a deconfined regime, where the field reaches distances $\gg 1/B$ and the damping rate becomes parametrically small. These results provide qualitative and quantitative insights that may inform more realistic scenarios involving highly magnetized compact objects.

Abstract: We study the black hole solution and gravitational wave polarizations in a M-subset of the Einstein-aether theory with Lorentz invariance violated by an unit norm vector field -- the aether field $u^a$. This M-subset of Einstein-aether theory has a form of Einstein-Maxwell theory with a term of Lagrange multiplier potential $λ(u_au^a\mp1)$. We find that if the aether field is timelike, there is no static black hole solution existing, which is different from the result reported in Phys. Rev. D {\bf64} 024028. When the aether field is spacelike, there exists a static solution -- $D$-dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom-like black hole solution, in which the aether charge have a minimum and maximum values. The conception of the aether charge also exists in the $c_i$ subset of the Einstein-aether theory. The Smarr formula and the first law can be still constructed via the extended method of Killing potential. For the linearized M-subset Einstein-aether theory with the timelike aether field, we find the speed of spin-2 modes is unit, which aren't dependent on spacetime dimensions $D$ and aether constant $b_1$, but some parts of polarizations are disappeared. The speed of spin-1 modes is unit also. The third kind mode is the longitudinal aether-metric mode, which is linearly time dependent and not the spin-0 mode.

Abstract: Stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) poses significant challenges for data analysis and parameter inference in future space-based gravitational-wave missions, such as LISA and Taiji, as it appears as an additional stochastic component along with instrumental noise. Previous studies have developed various approaches to distinguish the SGWB from instrumental noise, often under simplified assumptions such as static or equal-arm configurations. However, in realistic scenarios, time-varying arm-lengths introduce additional complexities that require careful modeling. In this work, we investigate the impact of template construction on SGWB parameter estimation under realistic orbital configurations. Using the simulated SGWB signals and dominant instrumental noise sources, we compare three template strategies: time-averaged template constructed from segmented data, equal-arm template, and a template treating the arm-lengths as a free parameter. Our results show that the time-averaged template yield improves parameter estimation accuracy under time-varying arm-lengths, whereas introducing the effective arm-length as a free parameter increases estimation uncertainty. These findings highlight the importance of realistic template construction for high-precision SGWB analysis in future space-based missions.

Abstract: Black holes, the simplest solution to Einstein's field equations, do not emit light, making their observations a major challenge for researchers. However, discovery of binary black holes (BBHs) in 2015 by LIGO has transformed the study of compact objects, with over 300 BBHs recorded, providing a new avenue for probing new physics. GWs remain a prominent and precise method of observing not only BBHs, but also dark matter and cosmic strings. Cosmic strings -- hypothetical one dimensional topological defects formed in the early universe, are yet to be observed, with multiple detection methods such as particle radiation, gravitational waves and lensing being proposed. Here we present a novel framework to search for cosmic strings by modeling them as perturbations within non-rotating black hole spacetime, focusing on their imprint on the spectrum of quasinormal modes (QNMs). Our numerical simulations identify a lower limit on perturbation strength, $λ\sim 10^{-10}$ for uncharged string and $λ\sim 10^{-7}$ for charged string, below which cosmic string effects become unobservable in QNM signals. By analyzing eigenvalue splitting and centers, we show that cosmic string properties impart distinct and detectable features to GW signals. Our results establish QNM analysis as a powerful, alternative observational strategy for constraining or detecting cosmic strings, and offer an inverse approach to estimate string energy or charge if a signal is detected. With upgrades in LIGO technologies and advanced multimessenger astronomy under development, these findings highlight new potential for detecting cosmic strings.

Abstract: We show how to coherently combine information from a population of sub-threshold, gravitational-wave binary neutron star post-merger remnants. Although no individual event in our synthetic population can be claimed as a confident detection, we show how to statistically determine the fraction of merger events that promptly collapse to form a black hole, compared to those for which a neutron star survives the merger for at least tens of milliseconds. This fraction, when combined with information about the neutron star mass distribution gleaned from the inspiral portion of the signals, provides an indirect measure of the neutron star maximum mass. Using conservative measures of the post-merger waveforms, we show that 50-70 events with binary neutron star inspiral measurements can be combined to give an $11-20\%$ fractional uncertainty on the maximum mass of rapidly rotating, hot neutron stars, which can potentially be turned into a $12-21\%$ fractional constraint on the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff mass. We discuss how this measure of the hot nuclear equation of state can be combined with information of cold neutron stars to see the effect of temperature on physics in the densest regions of the Universe.

Abstract: We study the radiative process of three entangled quantum probes initially prepared in a tripartite W state. As a basic set-up, we consider the probes to be inertial in flat spacetime and investigate how the radiative process is affected by different probe configurations. We take the quantum probes as either static or moving with uniform velocities and consider different switching scenarios. Our main observation confirms that the radiative process depends distinctively on the initial configuration in which the probes are arranged, as well as on the direction of the probe velocity. We also extend our analysis to a thermal environment, thereby simulating a more realistic background. We thoroughly discuss the effects due to different switchings, the thermal background, and probe motion on the radiative process of these tripartite entangled probes. We also comment on how the observations from this work can help prepare a set-up least affected by quantum decoherence.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a quantum-optical treatment of acceleration radiation for atoms freely falling into a Schwarzschild black hole when the ambient field is a massive spin-1 (Proca) field. Building on the HBAR framework of Scully and collaborators, we analyze two detector realizations: a charged-monopole current coupling and a physical electric-dipole coupling, both within a cavity that isolates a single outgoing Schwarzschild mode prepared in the Boulware state. Using a near-horizon stationary-phase analysis, we show that the thermal detailed-balance factor governing excitation versus absorption is universal and depends only on the near-horizon Rindler coordinate transformation. At the same time, the absolute spectra acquire distinctive Proca signatures: a hard mass threshold, polarization-dependent prefactors, and axial/polar greybody transmissions. Promoting single-pass probabilities to escaping rates yields a master equation whose steady state is geometric and whose entropy flux obeys an HBAR-style area-entropy relation identical in form to the scalar case, with all vector-field specifics entering through the radiative area change. Our results provide a controlled pathway to probe longitudinal versus transverse responses, mass thresholds, and polarization-resolved greybody effects in acceleration radiation, and set the stage for extensions to rotating backgrounds, alternative exterior states, and detector-engineering strategies.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the quantum and radiative properties of a recently proposed static bumblebee black hole arising from a general Lorentz-violating vacuum configuration. The analysis begins with the geometric structure of the solution and the thermodynamic temperature obtained from the surface-gravity prescription. The associated thermodynamic topological structure is also examined. Quantum particle production is then analyzed for bosonic and fermionic fields using the tunneling method. Analytic greybody bounds are derived for spin-0, spin-1, spin-2, and spin-1/2 fields. Furthermore, full greybody factors are computed with the sixth-order WKB method, together with the corresponding absorption cross sections and their characteristic spin-dependent peak patterns. These results support the evaluation of the evaporation lifetimes and the emission rates of energy and particle modes associated with each spin contribution, followed by a comparison of the high-frequency regime with other Lorentz-violating geometries, including the \textit{metric} bumblebee, \textit{metric-affine} bumblebee, Kalb-Ramond, and non-commutative Kalb-Ramond black holes. In addition, greybody factors are obtained using a quasinormal-mode-based prescription.

Abstract: We introduce and study \emph{brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces} in Newtonian and relativistic spacetimes. Starting from the classical cycloidal brachistochrone in a constant gravitational field, we construct a Newtonian ``brachistochrone-ruled worldsheet'' whose rulings are time-minimizing trajectories between pairs of endpoints. We then generalize this construction to stationary Lorentzian spacetimes by exploiting the reduction of arrival-time functionals to Finsler- or Jacobi-type length functionals on a spatial manifold. In this framework, relativistic brachistochrones arise as geodesics of an associated Finsler structure, and brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces are timelike surfaces ruled by these time-minimizing worldlines. We work out explicit examples in Minkowski spacetime and in the Schwarzschild exterior: in the flat case, for a bounded-speed time functional, the brachistochrones are straight timelike lines and a simple family of brachistochrone-ruled surfaces turns out to be totally geodesic; in the Schwarzschild case, we show how coordinate-time minimization at fixed energy reduces to geodesics of a Jacobi metric on the spatial slice, and outline a numerical scheme for constructing brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces. Finally, we discuss basic geometric properties of such surfaces and identify natural Jacobi fields along the rulings.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the optical properties of a black hole in non-minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills theory, illuminated by a thin accretion disk composed of free, electrically neutral plasma. In our setup, matter follows stable circular orbits outside the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), while inside the ISCO, it rapidly plunges into the black hole. We begin by analyzing the orbital dynamics of massive and massless particles around the black hole. Our results indicate that as the non-minimal coupling parameter increases, the radii of both the ISCO and the photon sphere, together with the corresponding energy and angular momentum for massive particles or the impact parameter for photons, decrease approximately linearly. Moreover, compared with the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordström black holes, the non-minimal coupling extends the range of the impact parameter and slightly enhances the redshift effect in the images. Additionally, due to the significant influence of the non-minimal coupling parameter on the event horizon, the observed intensity of the non-minimally coupled black hole image under the selected emission model ultimately turns out to be weaker than that of the other two types of black holes, regardless of the inclination angle between the accretion disk and observation planes.

Abstract: We compute the fundamental and overtone quasinormal modes of a regular, asymptotically flat black hole supported by a Dehnen-type matter halo. Gravitational perturbations in this background split into two distinct axial sectors, and our analysis confirms that the presence of the halo parameter $a$ breaks the isospectrality that holds in vacuum. The dependence of the quasinormal spectrum on $a$ is moderate for the fundamental modes and even weaker for the overtones, which approach one another in the complex-frequency plane as the halo parameter increases. No enhancement or rapid growth of overtone amplitudes is observed, indicating that the halo does not induce the type of strong near-horizon effects characteristic of quantum-corrected or exotic compact objects. Overall, our results show that the dark-matter halo introduces controlled and comparatively mild modifications to the ringdown spectrum while preserving its qualitative structure.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) are thought to accelerate cosmic rays (CRs) to several PeV energies, but this has yet to be confirmed as general behavior. Although several sources show ~100 TeV gamma rays, their hadronic origin is uncertain; a matching neutrino signal would provide definitive evidence. Using insight from the theory of diffusive shock acceleration, we evaluate the spectra and environments of the sample of Galactic SNRs to identify those most likely to be hadronic, categorizing them into a tiered catalog depending on their likelihood to produce neutrinos detectable in the TeV-PeV range. We then calculate the estimated stacked sensitivity of IceCube for each tier using IceCube's ten-year public data. Our results suggest that this strategy of stacking SNRs and carefully excluding leptonic sources by using theoretical arguments may allow for a detection of this source class that would otherwise be impossible. A follow-up analysis of these catalogs using TeV-PeV sensitive neutrino data from IceCube (or similar telescopes like KM3NeT/ARCA) offers the most decisive, near-future test for the hadronic nature of these SNRs and the maximum energies of their CR spectra.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We observed the isolated neutron star RX J2143.0+0654 with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the UVOIR wavelength range (0.14-1.7 $μ$m). The UV part is consistent with a Rayleigh-Jeans tail of a thermal spectrum, $f_ν\propto ν^2$, while a power-law spectrum, $f_ν\propto ν^α$ with $α\sim -0.8$, dominates in the NIR-optical. A joint fit of the UVOIR and contemporaneous X-ray spectra with a two-component blackbody with possible absorption features + power-law optical spectrum yields the following temperature and apparent radius of the colder component (which gives the main contribution in the UV): $kT_{\rm cold}\approx 45$ eV, $R_{\rm cold}\approx 6 d_{260}$ km, where $d_{260}$ is the distance in units of 260 pc. The temperature and radius of the hotter component, $kT_{\rm hot}\approx 106$ eV and $R_{\rm hot} \approx 1.5d_{260}$ km, the parameters of an absorption feature at 0.74 keV, and the properties of X-ray pulsations, are the same as found in previous X-ray observations. In the NIR images the neutron star is possibly surrounded by extended emission with a characteristic size of $\sim 2''$ and flux densities of about 1.7 and 0.9 $μ$Jy at 1.54 and 1.15 $μ$m, respectively. Comparison with a previous HST observation in the optical 14 years ago shows a proper motion $μ\approx 6$ mas yr$^{-1}$, which corresponds to a small transverse velocity of $7d_{260}$ km s$^{-1}$. It is consistent with the hypothesis that the neutron star was born in the vicinity of the solar system about 0.5 Myr ago.

Abstract: We report the first detection of X-ray polarization with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) from the X-ray pulsar (XRP) 4U 1954+319. The source belongs to an extremely rare class of systems in which a slowly rotating neutron star accretes from the dense wind of a red supergiant companion. Coherent pulsations are detected at $P_{\rm spin}=5.49\pm0.05$ h, which is one of the longest spin periods known among XRPs. While the phase-averaged analysis shows no significant polarization, with a 99% confidence minimum detectable polarization (MDP$_{99}$) of 5.0% in the 2-8 keV band, the phase-resolved analysis shows one interval at pulse maximum in which the polarization degree (PD) exceeds its MDP$_{99}$, giving ${\rm PD}=10.3\pm3.1$%. The polarization angle (PA) exhibits a smooth $\approx140^{\circ}$ rotation over the pulse, and a joint evaluation of all phase bins yields an overall detection significance of $3.3σ$. Using the rotating vector model, we identify the geometric solution that reproduces the observed PA variation. By subsequently applying an event-by-event derotation of the Stokes parameters based on this solution, we remove the PA swing and recover the phase-averaged polarization which is detected at the $5.2σ$ level.

Abstract: We have computed the physical processes involved in a head-on collision between a neutron star (NS) and a white dwarf (WD). The outcomes of such collisions vary depending on the mass and type of the WD. We have separately examined the dynamical processes for collisions between NSs and helium WDs (He-WDs), carbon-oxygen WDs (CO-WDs), and oxygen-neon WDs (ONe-WDs). We aim to investigate whether the collision can trigger a thermonuclear explosion of the WD, and if not, whether the NS can remain bound within the WD to form a Thorne-Zytkow-like object (TZlO). For a thermonuclear explosion to occur, at least two conditions must be satisfied: (i) the collision-induced temperature must reach the ignition threshold of the relevant nuclear reactions, and (ii) the burning material must remain in a degenerate state. For different types of WDs, there exist parameter ranges where both conditions are fulfilled, implying that NS-WD collisions can indeed induce thermonuclear explosions, leading to sub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia supernovae or other exotic optical transients powered by thermonuclear explosion. On the other hand, the formation of a TZlO requires that the WD material exerts sufficient drag on the NS to prevent its escape, while the interaction must not trigger a thermonuclear explosion of the WD. Our results indicate that such conditions can be realized in the case of low-mass CO-WDs and low-mass ONe-WDs, provided that the viscous coefficient is sufficiently large.

Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright millisecond radio pulses. Their origin is still unknown in the field of astronomy. A notable distinction among FRBs is that some sources repeat, while others appear to be non-repeating events. Interestingly, repeating FRBs tend to exhibit broader temporal widths and narrower spectral bandwidths compared to non-repeat events, suggesting they may arise from different physical mechanisms. However, current radio telescopes have limited coverage and sensitivity, which hinders a complete survey with continuous long-term monitoring. This issue makes it difficult to confirm repeat activity and potentially leads to misclassification of repeaters as non- repeaters; these are referred to as repeater candidates. To address this, machine learning techniques have emerged as a useful tool for classifying distinct FRB types in previous studies. In this study, we utilize the CHIME/FRB baseband catalog with three orders of magnitude better time resolution than the intensity catalog. Measured fluences are available in the baseband catalog, while only upper limits are reported in the intensity catalog. We apply machine learning to the baseband catalog to evaluate classification outcomes. We identify 15 repeater candidates among 122 non-repeating FRBs in the baseband catalog. Additionally, our classification identifies 31 sources previously categorized as repeater candidates as non-repeaters, highlighting a significant difference from the prior work. Of these repeater candidates, 14 overlap with previous findings, while 1 is newly identified in this work. Notably, one of our candidates was confirmed as a repeater by CHIME/FRB. Follow-up observations for the 14 candidates are highly encouraged.

Abstract: Recoiling remnants of black-hole mergers in dense environments can produce bright electromagnetic (EM) counterparts to the gravitational-wave (GW) emission. Significance assessments of such GW-EM candidates are restricted to time and sky-localisation consistency, omitting the physics governing the EM emission process. Different emission mechanisms, however, impose different observability constraints on the remnant black-hole recoil and spin, which are gravitational-wave observables. We present a statistical framework that includes such parameters. We assess the consistency of the GW190521-ZTF19abanrhr pair with two types of emission processes: a Blandford-Znajek jet closely aligned with the final spin axis and a diffusive isotropic flare. Assuming the sky-location of ZTF19abanrhr, we find these mechanisms to be respectively strongly and moderately disfavoured with log-evidences $\log_{10}{\cal I}_{\rm jet} = -1.65$ and $\log_{10}{\cal I}_{\rm diff} = -0.075$. Combining these with odds for a common sky-location $Ω$ we obtain respective combined odds $\log_{10} {\cal O}_{Ω,{\rm jet}}= -1.17$ and $\log_{10} {\cal O}_{Ω,{\rm diff}}= +0.39$ for a true GW-EM coincidence as opposed to a random one. Our method leverages a previously unexplored evidence axis to assess GW-EM associations and constrain both the physics powering flare mechanisms and the properties of AGNs.

Abstract: This dissertation explores the dynamics of relativistic spaceflight, focusing on the risks associated with collisions and photon interactions as a spacecraft approaches velocities near the speed of light. The study emphasizes two primary collision types: (1) collisions with interstellar dust and particles, and (2) interactions with cosmic molecules, specifically hydrogen. Using principles of energy conservation and relativistic mechanics, the energy transfer from these collisions is calculated, showing that even small particles can impart massive energy at relativistic speeds. The dissertation also examines the impact of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, particularly its blue-shifting effect at high velocities, which influences photon interactions with the spacecraft. Additionally, the Schwinger limit, which sets an upper bound on the electromagnetic field strength for sustained relativistic travel, is discussed in the context of photon-induced pair production. Lastly, advanced photon interactions, such as Compton scattering, are analyzed for their role in thermal management and spacecraft design. The findings highlight the importance of shielding, thermal regulation, and collision avoidance strategies in the design of spacecraft for interstellar travel, offering insights into the potential challenges and solutions for achieving relativistic spaceflight.

Abstract: Radiation-pressure instability was identified soon after the seminal classical accretion disk models of Shakura-Sunyaev and Novikov-Thorne, yet its full implications remain an active area of investigation. These models form the backbone of our understanding of accretion onto compact objects and successfully describe the phenomenology of black hole and neutron star X-ray binaries, as well as luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN), in the regime of high mass accretion rates. At luminosities approaching a significant fraction of the Eddington limit (L/LEdd > 0.1), standard thin disks are predicted to become thermally unstable due to the dominance of radiation pressure. This prediction has found empirical support in several Galactic stellar-mass black hole systems, where the instability manifests as quasi-periodic, large-amplitude luminosity oscillations, so-called "heartbeat states", and has been proposed as a driver of observed signatures of deterministic chaos in accretion-driven light curves. The scope of radiation-pressure-induced variability extends beyond stellar-mass black holes: both black holes across mass scales and accreting neutron stars can exhibit related behavior, though the presence of a boundary layer in neutron stars adds complexity and offers a unique laboratory for testing the interplay between accretion dynamics and the central object. On extragalactic scales, the instability has been invoked to explain the duty cycles and apparent short lifetimes of radio-loud AGN, as well as the dramatic spectral-state transitions seen in Changing-Look AGN.

Abstract: Mrk~421 is one of the most fascinating blazars, widely studied across the electromagnetic spectrum using observations at various wavebands, from radio to the TeV gamma ray bands. We present the first detailed spectral and timing analysis of the TeV blazar Mrk~421 based on 45 X-ray observations from the \textit{NICER} X-ray telescope, collected over two years from 2022 to 2024. The source exhibits strong X-ray variability across intraday and long-term timescales. During this period, we observe a dramatic change in flux, from $\sim 50$ to $\sim 1380$~counts~s$^{-1}$, representing a $\sim 28$-fold increase. Spectral modeling with power-law, broken power-law, and log-parabolic functions shows that the log-parabola provides the most accurate description of the X-ray spectra. The hardness ratio analysis confirms a \textit{harder-when-brighter} trend, consistent with the anticorrelation between flux and both $Γ$ and $α$. Correlation studies reveal a positive relation between $α$ and $β$, a negative correlation between $β$ and synchrotron peak energy $E_{\mathrm{p}}$, and a positive correlation between $E_{\mathrm{p}}$ and flux. These observed features can be interpreted within the framework of energy-dependent particle acceleration in blazar jets, which are often associated with turbulence, strong magnetic fields, and relativistic outflows. This work demonstrates that observations from \textit{NICER} can play an important role in blazar variability studies and motivate future multiwavelength campaigns aimed at fully characterizing the dynamical processes in relativistic jets.

Abstract: We present the astrometric identification of 80 known radio pulsars as unresolved continuum sources detected at 144 MHz in the second data release of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS DR2), which covers 27% of the Northern hemisphere. These identifications represent the majority ($\geq$ 86%) of radio pulsars present in the LoTSS DR2 footprint and provide independent celestial positions and flux densities at 144 MHz. We compare LoTSS flux densities with literature values from various image and time-domain observations and find good agreement for all but two pulsars. We attribute these flux density deviations to intrinsic pulsar properties (nulling and off-pulse emission). We investigate criteria to select promising pulsar candidates using data from the upcoming LoTSS release of the entire Northern sky ($δ>0^\circ$), as well as the LOFAR LBA Sky Survey (LoLSS) at 54 MHz (covering $δ>24^\circ$). Of the 80 detections, 35 (44%) were blindly redetected based on their linear or circular polarization. Therefore we conclude that candidate selection based on polarization properties is a promising approach. Candidate selection can be supplemented with spectral indices via cross-matching to LoLSS sources at 54 MHz, as the high sensitivity of LoTSS is not matched by image-domain surveys at higher frequencies.

Abstract: We study phase-transition-like behavior in neutron stars using a simplified, piecewise equation of state that couples a modified van der Waals-type core to a polytropic crust. The model remains analytically tractable while allowing for nonlinear density dependence. We impose thermodynamic and causal consistency conditions and determine the critical densities at which the curvature of the pressure-energy density relation changes. In the non-relativistic limit, the generalized Lane-Emden equations describe a smooth core-crust transition layer. We integrate the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations across different $(τ_1,σ_1)$ regimes, where these parameters encode thermal and interaction effects in the core. The resulting mass-radius sequences yield low neutron star masses $(0.99-2.05)M_{\odot}$, and the chemical potential exhibits the characteristic signatures of phase-transition behavior at densities well above the matching point. Our results show that analytic EOS models can reproduce the key phenomenology of phase transitions and provide a controlled framework for exploring low-mass neutron star configurations.

Abstract: The magnetar Swift J1555.2-5402 was discovered in outburst on 2021 June 3 by the Burst Alert Telescope on board the Swift satellite. Early X-ray follow-up revealed a spin period P~3.86 s, a period derivative Pdot~3e-11 s/s, dozens of short bursts, and an unusually flux decline. We report here on the X-ray monitoring of Swift J1555.2-5402 over the first ~29 months of its outburst with Swift, NICER, NuSTAR, INTEGRAL and Insight-HXMT, as well as radio observations with Parkes soon after the outburst onset. The observed 0.3-10 keV flux remained at levels >~1e-11 erg/cm^2/s for nearly 500 days before dropping by a factor of ~10 from its June 2021 peak towards the end of the monitoring campaign. During this time span, the spectrum was dominated by a single blackbody, with temperature attaining approximately a constant value (~1.2 keV) while the inferred radius shrank from ~1.7 km to ~0.3 km (assuming a source distance of 10 kpc). The long-term spin-down rate (Pdot~3.6e-11 s/s) is only ~15 % higher than that measured in the first 30 days. No periodic or burst-like radio emission was detected, in line with what has been previously reported using different radio facilities. The persistently high temperature, shrinking hotspot, and a prolonged bright flux plateau followed by a fast dimming observed during the outburst evolution pose a challenge for the outburst mechanisms proposed so far.

Abstract: We present the first optical ($BVR$) polarimetric observations of Swift J1727.8$-$1613 during its 2023--2024 outburst. Observations were performed during the X-ray hard-to-soft state transition, the soft state and the decaying hard state of the source. For the vast majority of nights, we detect statistically significant polarization of ${\approx}1$\%, a fraction of which is of interstellar origin. We find a significant change of polarization coinciding in time with discrete radio ejections. The direction of this polarization variation differs from the directions inferred from the X-ray, sub-mm and radio polarization angles, as well as from the resolved jet orientation. After correcting for the interstellar component, we find that the intrinsic polarization degree remained approximately constant at PD $\approx 0.3$\% throughout the hard-intermediate state. We explore several possible origins for the polarization and conclude that it is most plausibly produced by scattering within the optically thin accretion disk wind. The intrinsic polarization angle, PA $\approx-15°$, is notably offset from the jet axis, which we interpret as evidence for a misalignment between the black hole spin and the orbital axis.

Abstract: We present a systematic search for signatures of terminal black-hole evaporation in short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) catalogs. An exploding primordial black hole (PBH) undergoing final-stage Hawking radiation is predicted to produce a distinctive "backwards burst"-a very short, spectrally hard transient with monotonically increasing flux and little or no longer-wavelength afterglow. We develop a forward-modeling framework that directly compares theoretical PBH evaporation light curves, computed with full Standard Model particle content and detector response folding, against empirical GRB pulse templates. Analyzing 39 well-characterized Swift sGRBs with non-detected or extremely faint afterglows, we find that all events exhibit fast-rise, slow-decay temporal profiles inconsistent with the PBH prediction. Model comparison via Akaike and Bayesian information criteria decisively favors conventional FRED or ERCA fits over the PBH template for every burst. No candidates for terminal PBH evaporation are identified. The null result yields an upper bound on the local PBH explosion rate density $R_{\mathrm{PBH}} \lesssim 10^5~\mathrm{pc}^{-3}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, comparable to constraints from dedicated TeV $γ$-ray searches. Our methodology establishes a robust template-matching approach that can be scaled to larger multi-instrument catalogs, providing a foundation for future searches targeting this unique signature of quantum gravity and early-Universe physics.

Abstract: We reconsider the problem of neutrino pair bremsstrahlung emission originating from the electromagnetic collisions of charged particles in nucleonic ($npeμ$) neutron star cores. Two limiting cases are considered: (i) protons are in the normal state and (ii) protons are in the superconducting state. In both cases, the dominant contribution to the bremsstrahlung emissivity $Q^{\mathrm{em}}_{\mathrm{Br}}$ comes from the transverse part of in-medium electromagnetic interactions. For non-superconducting matter, we obtain an unusual $Q^{\mathrm{em}}_{\mathrm{Br}}\propto T^{23/3}$ temperature dependence due to the dynamical character of plasma screening in the transverse channel, but considerably smaller values of $Q^{\mathrm{em}}_{\mathrm{Br}}$ than in previous studies, rendering the considered process unimportant in practice. In contrast, for superconducting and superfluid matter, the neutrino emission processes involving nucleons are suppressed and $Q^{\mathrm{em}}_{\mathrm{Br}}$ due to lepton collisions provides the residual contribution to the neutrino emissivity of neutron star core matter. In the superconducting case, the plasma screening becomes static and the standard $Q^{\mathrm{em}}_{\mathrm{Br}}\propto T^{8}$ temperature scaling is restored. Simple analytical expressions for $Q^{\mathrm{em}}_{\mathrm{Br}}$ in both limiting cases are provided.

Abstract: Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) data have been used to estimate the masses and radii of the rotation-powered millisecond pulsars PSR J0030$+$0451, PSR J0740$+$6620, PSR J0437$-$4715, PSR J1231$-$1411, and PSR J0614$-$3329, sometimes in joint analyses with X-ray Multi-Mirror (XMM-Newton) data. These measurements provide invaluable information about the properties of cold, catalyzed matter beyond nuclear saturation density. Here we present the results of our modeling of NICER data on PSR J0437$-$4715 using several different models of hot thermal X-ray emitting spots on the stellar surface. For this pulsar, previous Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) observations established that there is also a modulated nonthermal component to the emission, but the previously published analysis of NICER data did not model this component. We find that the Bayesian evidence is significantly higher when the modulated nonthermal component is included, and that omission of this component leads to poor fits to the bolometric NICER data and thus risks bias in the resulting radius estimates. Our models, which we pursue to inferential convergence, therefore have modulated nonthermal emission, and our headline model has in addition three uniform-temperature thermally-emitting circular spots. Using this model, the symmetric 68% credible range in the radius is 11.8 km to 15.1 km, which at the independently-measured mass of $M=1.418\pm 0.044~M_\odot$ is consistent with previous reports of the radius of the $\sim 1.4~M_\odot$ pulsar PSR J0030$+$0451. We discuss the implications of this measurement for the equation of state of dense matter.

Abstract: When a moving gravitational-wave (GW) source travels behind a massive astrophysical object, its signal is gravitationally lensed, showing a waveform distortion similar to a Paczyński curve. We present a first study of the lensing signature of a massive black hole (MBH) on a frequency-dependent GW signal from a moving binary merger. For both light and GW sources in a Keplerian circular orbit around a MBH lens, the self-lensing geometry breaks the microlensing degeneracy in the Einstein radius crossing timescale $t_{\rm E}$. The duration of the curve ($2 t_{\rm E}$) becomes independent on the MBH mass $M_{\rm MBH}$, and provides a direct measure of the distance $d_{\rm LS}$ to the MBH. However, $M_{\rm MBH}$ remains unknown. We show that, in GW signals, the redshifted mass $M_{{\rm MBH},z}$ can additionally be obtained from the interference pattern, by measuring the modulation period $T$, the GW frequency $f$, and $t_{\rm E}$: $M_{{\rm MBH},z}\simeq 2.5\times 10^6\,M_\odot\,(t_{\rm E}/[100\,{\rm s}])\,(f\,T)^{-1}$. If this lensing signature is not considered, it may be confused with other waveform distortions, especially in the modeling of overlapping signals in next generation ground-based GW detectors. The observation of one of these curves and its associated parameters may help (1) constrain the orbital distance $d_{\rm LS}$ of sources, especially around low mass MBHs at the centers of star clusters and galaxies, (2) additionally estimate the mass $M_{{\rm MBH},z}$ of these MBHs, and (3) infer the orbital inclination of the binary. Simultaneously obtaining $d_{\rm LS}$ and $M_{{\rm MBH},z}$ through self-lensing can help constrain the astrophysical environments where GW signals come from.
