Abstract: The Starlink Tables Infrastructure Library Tool Set (STILTS) is a powerful suite for astronomical data analysis, particularly useful when dealing with large datasets. However, like other software suites in astronomy its comprehensive syntax creates a significant learning curve to new users. To address this, we present STILTS-NLI, a natural language interface that generates STILTS commands from user prompts, with agentic support for a user-friendly experience. We developed STILTS-NLI by fine-tuning a compact, open-source Large Language Model (LLM) on a synthetically generated dataset. This dataset was curated and validated to ensure both comprehensive coverage of key STILTS functionalities and the syntactic correctness of the resulting commands. Our results demonstrate that this specialised model generates valid commands that match and in some cases outperform larger proprietary models. By leveraging small, open-source models, STILTS-NLI provides an accessible, low-resource solution that lowers the barrier to entry for using STILTS.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of geometric distortion is essential for precise astrometric calibration in wide-field imaging surveys. We present a self-calibration method based on Zernike polynomials, applied to imaging data from the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST). Our approach constructs a global geometric distortion (GD) model from the position offsets of stars in the WFST r-band relative to Gaia DR3, achieving a median systematic uncertainty of below 10 mas for individual exposures. The correspondence between Zernike polynomials and optical aberrations reveals that the global GD of WFST is dominated by coma, inherent to the optical design, while rapid variations are likely attributed to the atmospheric dispersion corrector. Applying this method to 82 exposures from a single night (20250218), we find that the relative positions of the WFST CCDs remain stable, with standard deviations of less than 0.1 pixel in translation and 1.8 arcsec in rotation. The corrected WFST astrometric system is thereby tied to the Gaia DR3 coordinate frame, with further refinements to be presented in future work.

Abstract: One of the primary objectives of modern astronomy is the atmospheric characterization of Earth-like exoplanets at visible and infrared wavelengths. Achieving this goal requires extremely sensitive detectors capable of measuring faint signal of the exoplanet at the single-photon level while maintaining near-zero dark count rates. In the infrared, however, conventional semiconducting detector technologies struggle to meet these stringent requirements. In this work we demonstrate single-photon counting with superconducting Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors at the wavelengths 3.8, 8.5, 18.5, and 25 $μ$m and measure resolving powers ($E/δE$) of 9.9, 5.9, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively, with corresponding dark count rates of 4, 8, 34, and 48 mHz. Our membrane-based devices reach phonon-loss limited performance at 3.8 $μ$m, more than doubling the performance attainable with comparable solid-substrate devices. These results showcase the detector technology in the mid-infrared and the intricate measurement setup required for these sensitive detectors. We discuss how the detector design and measurement setup can be further optimized to increase the detector performance in the mid-infrared.

Abstract: Advancing the technological development of small inner working angle (IWA) coronagraphs is essential to enabling high-contrast imaging of temperate exoplanets with future extremely large telescopes. The PIAACMC has been shown to closely approach the theoretical limit for coronagraphic throughput but its performance has not been fully characterised on-sky. This study serves as the first on-sky characterisation of contrast and IWA performance of the PIAACMC and its first technological demonstration at sub-micron wavelengths. We designed and manufactured phase-shifting focal plane masks optimised for two cases, a narrowband 875 filter (875nm, 3% band) and a broadband z' filter (908nm, 14% band). We tested the coronagraphs both with an internal source and on-sky using MagAOX, the extreme adaptive optics instrument for the Magellan Clay 6.5 m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. We show good recovery of the off-axis light's PSF shape within 92% and 97% depending on the separation when aligning the inverse set of PIAA lenses. We demonstrate sub-lambda/D IWAs of about 0.74 lambda/D in 875 and 0.76 lambda/D in z'. We reach average raw contrasts within 1 and 5 lambda/D with the internal source of about 1.6e-3 in 875 and 1.3e-3 in z'. These are mainly limited by the focal plane mask manufacturing errors, jitter, and residual quasi-static speckles in MagAO-X. We also show on-sky average raw contrasts within 1 and 5 lambda/D of about 1.4e-2 in 875 and 7.8e-3 in z'. These are likely limited by wavefront control, low-order aberrations, and poor observing conditions. Future work will improve the design and manufacturing processes of the focal plane masks to improve robustness and reach deeper contrast, as well as integrate focal plane wavefront control for non-common path aberrations correction.

Abstract: The era of large astronomical surveys generates massive image catalogs requiring efficient and secure access, particularly during pre-publication periods where data confidentiality and integrity are paramount. While Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles guide the eventual public dissemination of data, traditional security methods for restricted phases often lack granularity or incur prohibitive performance penalties. To address this, we present a framework that integrates a flexible policy engine for fine-grained access control with a novel GPU-accelerated implementation of the AES-GCM authenticated encryption protocol.
  The novelty of this work lies in the adaptation and optimization of a parallel tree-reduction strategy to overcome the main performance bottleneck in authenticated encryption on GPUs: the inherently sequential Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) authentication hash (GHASH). We present both the algorithmic adaptation and its efficient execution on GPU architectures. Although similar parallelization techniques have been explored in cryptographic research, this is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of their integration into a high-throughput encryption framework specifically designed for large-scale astronomical data. Our implementation transforms the sequential GHASH computation into a highly parallelizable, logarithmic-time process, achieving authenticated encryption throughput suitable for petabyte-scale image analysis.
  Our solution provides a robust mechanism for data providers to enforce access policies, ensuring both confidentiality and integrity without hindering research workflows, thereby facilitating a secure and managed transition of data to public, FAIR archives.

Abstract: Using advanced machine learning techniques, we developed a method for reconstructing precisely the arrival direction and energy of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays from the voltage traces they induced on ground-based radio detector arrays.
  In our approach, triggered antennas are represented as a graph structure, which serves as input for a graph neural network (GNN). By incorporating physical knowledge into both the GNN architecture and the input data, we improve the precision and reduce the required size of the training set with respect to a fully data-driven approach. This method achieves an angular resolution of 0.092° and an electromagnetic energy reconstruction resolution of 16.4% on simulated data with realistic noise conditions.
  We also employ uncertainty estimation methods to enhance the reliability of our predictions, quantifying the confidence of the GNN's outputs and providing confidence intervals for both direction and energy reconstruction. Finally, we investigate strategies to verify the model's consistency and robustness under real life variations, with the goal of identifying scenarios in which predictions remain reliable despite domain shifts between simulation and reality.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present the discovery and subsequent 3.2 year monitoring campaign of the repeating fast radio burst FRB 20220529A with CHIME/FRB. We observe a gradual dispersion measure (DM) decline of $-0.881\pm0.001~\mathrm{pc}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}~\mathrm{year}^{-1}$ ($-1.235\pm0.001~\mathrm{pc}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}~\mathrm{year}^{-1}$ in the rest frame), implying a $\geq3.5\pm0.2$% decrease of the total electron column in the source environment, and we see scattering timescale variations over weeks to years. We observe a short-lived excursion in which the DM rises by $\sim 1~\mathrm{pc}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, immediately preceding a transient $\sim 2000~\mathrm{rad}~\mathrm{m}^{-2}$ Faraday rotation measure (RM) increase previously reported for this source, before returning to its gradual DM decline. We identify a local line-of-sight magnetic field around FRB 20220529A during this DM/RM excursion of $3.4 \pm 0.2~\mathrm{mG}$, corresponding to one of the most strongly magnetized FRB environments. We measure a decrease in the linear polarization fraction of FRB 20220529A bursts with decreasing frequency that we attribute to depolarization from multi-path propagation in the source environment. We also place a $5σ$ upper limit on the spectral luminosity of an associated persistent radio source of $\leq 5\times10^{28}~\mathrm{erg}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}~\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$ at 1.5 GHz. These observations are consistent with FRB 20220529A originating from a young ($\sim$ years to centuries old) expanding supernova remnant, with short-lived DM and RM variability arising from interactions with the supernova remnant or with a binary companion.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Non-magnetic Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) show two distinct X-ray components: a hard, optically thin component and a soft, optically thick, blackbody-like component, both produced in the boundary layer between the accretion disk and the White Dwarf (WD). An additional soft component originating from a more extended region has been reported in few CVs. In a short Chandra exposure, we identified a tentative X-ray eclipse in UU Aqr, a non-magnetic CV which shows deep optical eclipses. Using observations with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and the XMM-Newton, we detect total eclipses in the orbital intensity profiles of this system in the hard X-ray band (3-10 keV with XMM and 3-25 keV with NuSTAR). However, the soft X-ray band (0.3-2.0 keV) shows no evidence of an eclipse. Detailed eclipse modeling, energy-resolved power spectral analysis and broadband spectral modeling indicate that the hard absorbed X-ray emission originates from a compact region near the WD, such as a boundary layer, while the soft, unabsorbed and un-eclipsed X-ray emission originates in an extended region. Neither scattering of hard X-rays nor colliding winds can account for the observed un-eclipsed soft emission. We instead propose that this component is produced by shocks within vertically extended, radiatively driven accretion-disk winds. We also provide new estimates on the emitting regions, mass and radius of the WD and the donor star using eclipse modeling.

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are brief flashes of emission detectable to cosmological distances. Cosmology applications rely on an understanding of how the detected sample relates to the underlying population. To this end we examine the dispersion measure `tolerance' parameter employed by the FRB search tool \textsc{heimdall} and provide the relation between this and minimum search depth. Several FRB samples can be `retro-fitted' using this to more properly account for survey completeness.

Abstract: It is shown that conformal symmetry exists in force-free electrodynamics (FFE) in Minkowski spacetime, a foundational framework for describing magnetospheres around astronomical objects. In force-free magnetospheres, charges are constrained to move along magnetic field lines and experience zero Lorentz force, due to the everywhere perpendicular orientation of electric and magnetic fields. However, a general angle-preserving conformal mapping of force-free fields does not necessarily produce another physically admissible force-free configuration when sources are present. In this work, we demonstrate that such invariance can nevertheless arise for certain choices of the free functions. Specifically, the governing stream equation is shown to be invariant under Möbius transformations. This symmetry reveals a structural linkage between known solutions and, notably, maps the region inside a magnetospheric horizon (the lightsurface) of one solution to the exterior of its dual counterpart, and vice versa.

Abstract: The Dymnikova black hole represents a regular spacetime solution interpolating between a de Sitter core and an asymptotically Schwarzschild geometry. In this work, we investigate a generalized Dymnikova black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) and immersed in a cloud of strings (CS). We analyze how these additional matter sources modify the thermodynamic, optical, and dynamical properties of the spacetime.
  We derive the Hawking temperature and specific heat capacity and examine the thermal stability and phase structure of the black hole. The results reveal non-monotonic temperature behavior and parameter-dependent phase transitions. We further study photon dynamics, including the photon sphere and black hole shadow, and show that both PFDM and string cloud parameters significantly affect the shadow radius and strong-field structure.
  Additionally, we investigate the motion of massive test particles, circular orbits, and stability conditions. The corresponding effective potentials, specific energy, and angular momentum are analyzed. Finally, we explore quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) by computing the fundamental epicyclic frequencies and discuss how the model parameters encode observable astrophysical signatures.
