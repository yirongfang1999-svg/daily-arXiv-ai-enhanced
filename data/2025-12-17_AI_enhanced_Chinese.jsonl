We show that Barrow and R\u00e9nyi entropies yield a single unstable sector with global charge $W=-1$, while logarithmic and Kaniadakis corrections produce canceling defects with $W=0$, revealing topological structures absent in the Schwarzschild case. Using the modified metrics, we further calculate the photon-sphere radius and shadow size, showing that each modified entropy relation induces characteristic optical shifts. Thus, by comparing with Event Horizon Telescope observations of Sgr A$^\\ast$, we extract new bounds on all entropy-deformation parameters.

Here we present modelling of the HVF evolution in a sample of six well observed SNe Ia with the radiative-transfer code tardis.

These networks are subsequently used within a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework to infer the density enhancement parameters that most closely reproduce the HVF evolution. While we obtain good matches for the silicon profile, we find that a single density enhancement alone cannot simultaneously produce the observed silicon and calcium HVF evolution.

The ART-XC observation provides a highly uniform sky coverage without strong vignetting effects.

The model is tuned to reproduce existing multiwavelength data from X-ray upper limits and GeV to TeV gamma-ray observations. After accounting for the high particle background and its uncertainties, no significant emission is found in the assumed source region, and X-ray flux upper limits are derived. These limits are less constraining by up to a factor of three with respect to existing results obtained with narrow field-of-view telescopes and longer exposure times. Nonetheless, we place direct and independent constraints on Geminga's ambient magnetic field strength, which are compatible with other studies. Our methodology, including simulation for longer observation times, is applied for the first time to the wide field-of-view search for pulsar halos.

Numerous classical novae have been observed to emit \u03b3-rays (E > 100 MeV) detected by the Fermi-LAT. The prevailing hypothesis attributes this emission to the interaction of accelerated particles within shocks in the nova ejecta. However, the lack of non-thermal X-ray detection coincident with the \u03b3-rays remains a challenge to this theory. Methods. We performed similar analyses of the Fermi-LAT data for both novae to determine the duration, localization, and spectral properties of the \u03b3-ray emission. These results were compared with optical data from the AAVSO database and X-ray observations from NuSTAR, available for V1723 Sco 2024 only, to infer the nature of the accelerated particles. Finally, we used a physical emission model to extract key parameters related to particle acceleration. Results. V1723 Sco 2024 was found to be a very bright \u03b3-ray source with an emission duration of 15 days allowing us to constrain the spectral index and the total energy of accelerated protons. Despite early NuSTAR observations, no non-thermal X-ray emission was detected simultaneously with the \u03b3-rays. However, unexpected \u03b3-ray and thermal hard X-ray emission were observed more than 40 days after the nova outburst, suggesting that particle acceleration can occur even several weeks post-eruption. V6598 Sgr 2023, on the other hand, was detected by the Fermi-LAT at a significance level of 4\u03c3over just two days, one of the shortest \u03b3-ray emission durations ever recorded, coinciding with a rapid decline in optical brightness. Finally, the high ratio of \u03b3-ray to optical luminosities and \u03b3-ray to X-ray luminosities for both novae, as well as the curvature of the \u03b3-ray spectrum of V1723 Sco below 500 MeV, are all more consistent with the hadronic than the leptonic scenario for \u03b3-ray generation in novae.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The evolution is commonly divided into three stages: the adiabatic inspiral, the transition, and the plunge. To date, constructions of inspiral-transition-plunge waveforms have largely focused on Schwarzschild or Kerr background spacetimes. In this paper, we extend these efforts to spacetimes beyond Kerr by constructing such waveforms in a Kerr-Newman background. For simplicity, we allow the primary black hole to carry spin and charge while keeping the secondary object neutral and non-spinning. We work in the small charge-to-mass ratio regime and adopt the Dudley-Finley approximation, in which the gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations decouple. In particular, the gravitational sector satisfies a Teukolsky-like equation, enabling only minimal modifications relative to the Kerr case when constructing the waveform. Having the inspiral-transtion-plunge waveforms in hand, we studied observational prospects for constraining the charge of the central black hole. We find that, for intermediate-mass-ratio mergers observed with the Einstein Telescope, explicitly modeling the post-inspiral dynamics significantly tightens charge-to-mass ratio constraints. In particular, the bounds on the charge-to-mass ratio can reach $O(10^{-3})$ in the region of primary masses and spins where the post-inspiral signal dominates, yielding charge bounds that can be orders of magnitude tighter than those obtained from the inspiral alone or from the current bound with GW150914.

Accreting white dwarfs offer an ideal laboratory for addressing this question: their variability occurs on accessible timescales of seconds to minutes, and their optical spectra contain continuum and emission-line components that trace distinct disc regions. Broad-band timing studies have revealed time-lags similar to those observed in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei, suggesting propagating fluctuations and possible coupling to an inner hot flow. However, the blending of line and continuum light in broad filters prevents a physical interpretation of these signals. The 2040s will bring an unprecedented number of disc-accreting systems discovered by Rubin-LSST, space-based gravitational-wave observatories, and third-generation ground and space-based detectors. To extract disc physics from these sources, high-cadence optical spectral-timing, simultaneously resolving continuum and individual lines, is essential. Such measurements would directly map how variability propagates through discs, determine how the outer disc responds to changes in the inner flow, and test whether accretion physics is scale-invariant from white dwarfs to supermassive black holes.

Over more than 20 years of operation, the Pierre Auger Observatory has delivered invaluable insights into the modeling of hadronic interactions at energies beyond human-made particle accelerators. Notably, predictions from current models of hadronic interactions yield a muon deficit that becomes more pronounced with energy when compared to measurements. Presently, the interpretation of the nuclear mass composition estimated from the muon content is in tension with that from direct measurements of the depth of the maximum of electromagnetic profiles. Yet, the measured fluctuations of the muon content of air showers are in agreement with model predictions. These findings hint at small deviations in hadronic models that accumulate throughout the whole shower development rather than at large errors in the calculation of the first hadronic interactions. Also, in an independent, data-driven analysis, we show that the muon deficit can be alleviated if we allow a shift of the predicted depth of the maximum of air-shower profiles by 30 -50 g cm$^{-2}$ towards a heavier mass composition. More recently, we have also provided an updated measurement of the proton-proton cross-section at a center-of-mass energy of 57 TeV and the first estimates of the neutron content of air showers by exploiting late-time signals from the surface scintillator detectors of AugerPrime, the present upgrade of the Observatory.

They admit extra parameters beyond mass, charge, and angular momentum, leading to a richer phenomenology. Characterizing their allowed parameter space is therefore crucial, especially in light of the available data from electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations. The rotating hairy black hole solutions studied here are inspired by the gravitational decoupling method and satisfy the Einstein field equations with a conserved energy-momentum tensor that respects the strong energy conditions (SECs). We explore in detail the horizon structure of such black holes and report for the first time certain unique features, not observed in Kerr BHs. We investigate the sensitivity of the hairy parameters on the fundamental frequencies associated with the motion of matter in the hairy Kerr spacetime, and compare them with the Kerr scenario. The theoretical models aimed to explain the observed high-frequency observations (HFQPOs) in BHs are associated with the fundamental frequencies. Hence, such a study enables us to constrain the parameter space of the hairy Kerr spacetime by comparing the model-dependent HFQPO frequencies with the available observations. By comparing the kinematic models of HFQPOs with the observations of six BH sources, we report the most favored parameter space for each of these BHs. Our analysis also provides a framework to discern the most suitable model for each of these sources.

First, from the ground, we fit the data using a reference calibration signal (a diode) introduced to resolve degeneracies among the various instrument angles. Finally, we utilize on-sky observations of Tau A and the Moon to validate the results. By creating calibration datasets obtained with the reference diode, we evaluate the data quality and quantify phase switch errors to account for the fine polarization response. We also utilize Tau A and Moon observations to calibrate the system's response and stability over time. In addition, we calculate the refraction index of the Moon to be $n_{Moon}$ = 1.209 $\\pm$ 0.007 (stat) $\\pm$ 0.005 (sys) at 31 GHz under smooth-surface assumption. The results from fitting the instrument phase-switch error angle align with 0 deg at 2$\u03c3$ precision, indicating that no further correction is required within a few percent precision. The calibrations with astrophysical sources (Tau A and the Moon) yield consistent results that constrain the polarization angle and responsivity. The polarization efficiency aligns well with ground measurements and the Tau A characterization, whereas the Moon-based calibration is more affected by systematics. We find hints of responsivity variations over time, although the relative responsivity between channels is found to remain stable. In the future, we conclude that installing a live calibrator will enhance performance by continuously monitoring responsivity and, in turn, improving the mitigation of systematic effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Using both the worldline effective field theory for extended gravitating bodies and second-order perturbations of relativistic stellar models, we derive the nonlinear tidal deformation induced by an external gravito-electric tidal field to quadratic order. Through a suitable matching procedure, we provide for the first time the leading nonlinear tidal corrections to the conservative dynamics and gravitational-wave signal of binary systems. Quadratic Love numbers are enhanced more than the linear ones in the small-compactness limit. Because of this, despite entering the gravitational-wave phase at 8th post-Newtonian (PN) order, the leading quadratic Love number can be as important as the next-to-next-to-leading order linear tidal correction, which enters at 7th PN order, and is larger than the subleading point-particle contribution entering at 4th PN order. In particular, quadratic Love numbers can be as large as ~10% of the linear Love numbers in the late inspiral phase. Our approach provides a framework to also compute the (subleading) nonlinear effects induced by magnetic tidal fields and higher multipole moments, and sets the foundations for incorporating nonlinear tidal effects in high-precision gravitational-wave modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Focusing on static, spherically symmetric configurations, we show that all vacuum solutions of $D$--dimensional quasitopological gravity can be obtained from an auxiliary non--linear electrodynamics defined in a flat $(D+1)$--dimensional spacetime. The gravitational field equations reduce to an algebraic relation between a primary curvature invariant and the electric field strength, while the remaining dynamics is governed by a Gauss--law constraint for a point--like charge in the auxiliary space. This correspondence provides a transparent interpretation of higher--curvature gravitational interactions in terms of non--linear gauge dynamics and explains the absence of higher--derivative terms in the reduced equations. As illustrative examples, we apply the formalism to Born--Infeld and Hayward--type models, obtaining higher--dimensional regular black--hole solutions with a de~Sitter--like core. Our results extend the scope of the double--copy paradigm beyond Einstein gravity and suggest a unifying framework for a broad class of higher--curvature theories.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The recent observation of multiple quasinormal modes (QNMs) in GW250114 marks a major advance for observational black hole spectroscopy. This clear signal, together with the growing number of GW detections, highlights the need for accurate predictions of QNM spectra in beyond-GR theories in order to carry out precision searches for new physics. In this work, we continue to lay the foundation for such predictions using a modified Teukolsky formalism in conjunction with the eigenvalue perturbation method. We compute the spectral shifts of slowly rotating Johannsen-Psaltis black holes for $2 \\leq \\ell \\leq 10$, all $m$, and overtones $n = 0, 1, 2$, and confirm the large-$\\ell$ behavior of the modes by comparing with the WKB approximation. We find that these black holes admit definite-parity modes but break the isospectrality between even- and odd-parity QNMs at all spins, and that the shifts depend linearly on $m$ for slow spins. We further derive a general parity condition that any beyond-GR modification to the metric must satisfy to support definite-parity modes, providing new insights into isospectrality breaking and parity structure in gravitational perturbations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

How do large-scale dynamical instabilities, like warps and vertical waves, drive the star formation of the Galactic thin disk? Q2. Do star-forming regions form stochastically, driven by local self-propagating feedback, or are they triggered by a common dynamical process acting on Galactic scales? Do internal feedback loops and external interactions tend to sustain or quench star formation in the MW? Q3.
