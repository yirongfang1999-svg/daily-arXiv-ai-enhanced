We present simultaneous IR, X-ray and radio observations of Sgr A* on 2024 Apr 05 using JWST, NuSTAR, and VLA. We report the detection of a strong X-ray flare with a luminosity of $\\sim5.2x10^{35}$ erg/s coincident with a bright near-IR flare, and a brightening in radio about an hour later. We investigate the candidate physical mechanisms for the X-ray flare emission and conclude that this can best be explained by inverse Compton scattering of near-IR flare radiation. We propose a dynamic scenario analogous to a coronal mass ejection in which a magnetic flux rope is ejected from Sgr A*'s inner accretion flow with a current sheet extending down from the rope to the bulk of the accretion flow. Reconnection within the sheet produces oppositely directed flows of accelerated particles moving upwards towards the rope and downwards towards the accretion flow. Infrared radiation from the approaching energetic electrons is enhanced by beaming and up-scattered by thermal electrons in the accretion flow to produce the strong X-ray flare. Meanwhile, the relativistic electrons moving in the opposite direction away from the disk experience weaker magnetic fields so radiate at longer wavelengths by feeding into the magnetic flux tube and adiabatically cooled during its subsequent expansion. This physical picture attempts to unify the origin of the variable emission from Sgr A* at IR, X-ray and radio/submm wavelengths."}

In this study, we especially focus on the magnetic tidal deformability, which acts on the gravitational waveform from a neutron star binary merger as a higher-order effect than the electric tidal deformability, and derive the universal relations expressing the quasinormal modes, such as the fundamental ($f$-), 1st pressure ($p_1$-), and 1st spacetime ($w_1$-) modes, as a function of the magnetic tidal deformability.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "The pair-instability supernova (PISN) mechanism predicts a mass gap in the black hole population, where no stellar-origin black holes are expected to form. However, the binary black hole merger events GW190521 and GW231123 appear unusual, as current analyses place their component masses within the PISN mass gap. In this work, we investigate the relationship between different lensing magnifications and the inferred source-frame black hole masses for these two events. If the gravitational wave source is lensed, neglecting lensing effect can bias the inferred luminosity distance and hence the redshift, leading to an underestimation of the luminosity distance and consequently an overestimation of the source-frame masses, potentially placing them in the mass-gap region. For the two events in mass gap, when adopting a lower bound of $60 M_{\\odot}$ for the mass gap, the minimum magnifications required to shift the inferred source-frame masses below this gap boundary are found to be $μ=12.2$ for GW190521 and $μ=320.1$ for GW231123, corresponding to lensing-corrected luminosity distances of $11155\\, \\mathrm{Mpc}$ and $15207\\, \\mathrm{Mpc}$, respectively. These results provide a quantitative reference for assessing the lensing hypothesis as a possible explanation for the existence of black holes in the PISN mass gap."}

Here we investigate the origin of hierarchical mergers for GW241011 and GW241110 using the merger entropy index which measures the efficiency of entropy transfer for binary black hole mergers in general relativity. We find that GW241011 is consistent with hierarchical mergers in dense star clusters. The origin of GW241110 remains under debate due to its large distribution uncertainty, which leads to method-dependent inference and should be taken into account when interpreting this event in terms of hierarchical mergers."}

These systems encompass early-Universe stellar and primordial black holes, as well as intermediate-mass black-hole binaries, for which XG observatories are expected to deliver major discoveries. Validation against standard Bayesian inference demonstrates that NPE robustly reproduces complex and disconnected posterior structures across all network configurations. For a network of two misaligned L-shaped ET detectors (2L MisA), the posterior distributions on luminosity distance can become multimodal and degenerate with the sky position, leading to less precise distance estimates compared to the triangular ET configuration. However, the number of sky-location multimodalities is substantially lower than the eight expected with the triangular ET, resulting in improved sky and volume localization. Adding CE to the network further reduces sky-position degeneracies, and the better performance of the 2L MisA configuration over the triangle remains evident."}

In the SIMS, the photon index decreases from 2.1 to 1.7, indicating spectral hardening. The power density spectra (PDS) suggest the presence of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the HIMS and SIMS. The QPO frequency evolves from 0.1 Hz to 0.2 Hz in the HIMS, and further to 5.7 Hz in the SIMS. We also observe a decrease in QPO frequency from 5.7 Hz to 4.5 Hz during the SIMS.

In four-dimensional spacetime the trace-adjusted Einstein and Ricci tensors are identical, and their unadjusted traces are oppositely signed yet equal in absolute value. This allows us to express these Ricci invariants using Einstein's curvature tensor, facilitating a direct interpretation of the energy-momentum tensor. We present detailed plots illustrating the distribution of these invariants. Our findings underscore the requirement for four distinct layers of an anisotropic stress-energy tensor to create the warp bubble.

We provide a critical analysis of the work by Mattingly et al., particularly their underrepresentation of curvature invariants in their plots by 8 to 16 orders of magnitude. A comparison is made between the spacetime curvature of the Alcubierre warp-drive and that of a Schwarzschild black hole with a mass equivalent to the planet Saturn.

We compare three types of models: a broken power-law disk emissivity profile with no assumption about the coronal shape used in the previous work of the same observations, a compact lamppost corona, and an extended disk-like corona motivated by recent X-ray polarization results. Our goal is to measure the systematic uncertainties caused by the assumed geometry, with a focus on key parameters such as the black hole spin and the inclination of the inner accretion disk. We find that the disk-like corona gives a fit that is statistically similar to the broken power-law and lamppost models, but it leads to more physically reasonable results, such as a lower inclination angle of about $30^{\\circ}$. By using a variable disk density model, we measure the disk density to be $n_{\\rm e}\\approx10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-3}$, which is similar to earlier results. While the extended corona model infers a wider allowed parameter space for black hole spin and the inner radius of the disk-shaped coronal region, this reflects the additional physical freedom of the model.

Despite the extensive study of $f(R,T)$ gravity, the asymptotic implications of quadratic trace couplings in scalar field cosmology remain largely unexplored. We focus on a specific form given by $ f(R,T^φ) = R + αT^φ+ β(T^φ)^2/2$, in which the parameters $α$ and $β$ control the strength of non-minimal couplings between geometry and matter. We derive the set of cosmological equations for a spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic universe and construct the autonomous system of first-order differential equations using a compact set of dimensionless variables. This formulation provides a foundation for the qualitative analysis of the asymptotic behavior. We identify and classify all critical points and analyze their stability properties. Finally, the energy conditions and the presence of dynamical instabilities are examined. We study the general scenario $α\\neq 0$ and $β\\neq 0$, along with the subcases $α= 0$ and $β= 0$, in order to compare with minimally coupled quintessence $α= β= 0$. We find that the quadratic term in $T^φ$ admits late-time accelerated de Sitter-like critical solutions at the background level. However, several accelerated points lie in a degenerate scalar sector with $Q_s=0$, where the standard linear perturbation criteria are inconclusive, while the quasi-de Sitter point with $Q_s>0$ is of saddle type.

Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal", "summary": "High-energy blazar light curves, in X-rays and beyond, have historically preferred a log-normal flux distribution, signifying multiplicative processes either in the jet itself or due to connection(s) with accretion. Here we present 18 year archival Fermi-LAT light curves (0.1-100 GeV) of the flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) CTA 102 from August 2008 to November 2025, which underwent a huge flare in 2017, with a $\\sim$ factor of 100 jump in $γ$-ray flux, along with similar flaring in X-rays. Our statistical analyses confirm that neither the pre nor the post-flare total GeV light curves follow a strictly log-normal distribution. Instead, we observe a statistically significant reduction in skewness from the pre to the post-flare light curves, which implies the blazar transitioned from an energetic state with frequent flaring to a more plateaued state with occasional flaring. We further find that this state transition can be explained through magnetic relaxation, where many reconnection events caused the 2017 flare, after which the magnetic field was ordered and its energy reached a minimum. To explain this further, we use a Monte Carlo simulation of a modified minijets-in-a-jet model where GeV flares are produced only when a maximum number of minijets move toward the broad line region and towards the line of sight, in the context of an external Compton model. The flux distributions (both observed and simulated) could be fit by a modified log-normal power-law distribution, implying our minijets model can reproduce the GeV flares in CTA 102 as well as their flux distributions."}

They play extremely important roles in black hole shadows, gravitational lensings, quasi-normal modes, and spacetime topological properties.

In the present study, we give an extension of this geometric approach from spherically symmetric spacetimes to axially symmetric rotational spacetimes. In such a geometric approach, light rings in the equatorial plane are determined through the intrinsic curvatures in the optical geometry of Lorentz spacetime, which gives rise to a Randers-Finsler geometry for axially symmetric spacetimes. Specifically, light rings can be precisely determined by the condition of vanishing geodesic curvature, and the stability of light rings is classified through the intrinsic flag curvature in Randers-Finsler optical geometry. This geometric approach presented in this work is generally applicable to any stationary and axially symmetric spacetime, without imposing any restriction on the spacetime metric forms. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous demonstration to show that our geometric approach yields completely equivalent results with those derived from the conventional approach (based on the effective potential of photons)."}

In this paper, we present a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of 124 subluminous SNe~Ia, the largest sample of spectroscopically classified subluminous SNe~Ia observed with a single instrument, comprising 87 91bg-like, 12 86G-like, 18 04gs-like, and 7 02es-like events. We complement the published DR2 SALT2 light-curve parameters with new parameters obtained using template-based fits from SNooPy. Expansion velocities and pseudo-equivalent widths pEW of key spectral features are measured using Spextractor, and spectral averages are constructed for each subluminous subtype, binned by phase. We also analyze the host galaxy environments, both global and local, in terms of $g - z$ color, stellar mass, and directional light radius $d_{DLR}$. We find that all subluminous SNe~Ia (except the 02es-like subtype) are intrinsically red. This is evident by separating extrinsic from intrinsic color components. Since SALT2 is not trained on subluminous SNe~Ia, it compensates for their redder colors by inflating the $c$ parameter, thus extending the luminosity-width relation to negative values of x1. As expected, all subluminous SNe~Ia fall within the Cool region of the Branch et al. (2006) diagram, with the exception of 02es-like events, which show lower Si II 5972 pEW values. All subluminous subtypes tend to occur in more massive, redder host galaxies, and in the reddest local environments. Notably, 91bg- and 86G-like SNe~Ia explode at significantly larger normalized galactocentric distances. Finally, we identify the $pEW$ of the blended Ti II+Si II+Mg II absorption feature at 4300~A, along with s_BV, as robust and sufficient indicators for subclassifying subluminous SNe~Ia."}

In this study and for the first time, we assess the performance of various network configurations using neural posterior estimation (NPE) implemented in Dingo-IS-a method based on normalizing flows and importance sampling that enables fast and accurate inference. We focus on a specific science case involving short-duration, massive and high-redshift binary black hole (BBH) mergers with detector-frame chirp masses $M_{\\mathrm{d}} > 100$ M$_\\odot$. These systems encompass early-Universe stellar and primordial black holes, as well as intermediate-mass black-hole binaries, for which XG observatories are expected to deliver major discoveries. Validation against standard Bayesian inference demonstrates that NPE robustly reproduces complex and disconnected posterior structures across all network configurations. For a network of two misaligned L-shaped ET detectors (2L MisA), the posterior distributions on luminosity distance can become multimodal and degenerate with the sky position, leading to less precise distance estimates compared to the triangular ET configuration. However, the number of sky-location multimodalities is substantially lower than the eight expected with the triangular ET, resulting in improved sky and volume localization. Adding CE to the network further reduces sky-position degeneracies, and the better performance of the 2L MisA configuration over the triangle remains evident."}

We show that the strengths of the collapsing and dispersing modes of this scalar field will decide whether the collapse will end up in a black-hole or disperse. We find a locally naked null singularity as a critical case between these two and confirm that there is a single dimensionless parameter that determine the end state. This work is ansatz-independent, hence, true for all mass-less scalar field families. We also show that the geometrical mass of these singularities go to zero."}

Venkataratnam"], "title": "Black Hole Evaporation Driven by Non-Thermal Squeezing Through SNS and CSNS Dynamics", "comment": null, "summary": "In this work, we present a comprehensive semiclassical analysis of black hole radiation in a spatially flat FRW Universe for two fundamental nonclassical states: the Squeezed Number State (SNS) and the Coherent Squeezed Number State (CSNS). Unlike thermally modified earlier studies, SNS and CSNS constitute fully non-thermal, number-state-dependent quantum configurations. By embedding these states within the framework of semiclassical theory of gravity, we derive state-resolved expressions for the Hawking temperature, entropy variation, and corresponding mass loss of an evaporating black hole. The influence of the squeezing parameter $ρ$ and number state parameter $n$ on Hawking emission is examined through a series of analytical results supported by twelve detailed plots. The analysis reveals that the Hawking temperature exhibits monotonic growth with increasing $ρ$ and $n$, thereby elevating the effective temperature experienced at the black hole horizon. The entropy variations $Δ\\mathbb{S}_{\\mathrm{SNS}}$ and $Δ\\mathbb{S}_{\\mathrm{CSNS}}$ show strong nonlinear enhancement, especially at moderate and large squeezing values. Overall, the study extends earlier thermal squeezed-state approaches to a fully number-state-resolved framework, highlighting the sensitivity of Hawking emission to nonclassical quantum configurations. These findings contribute a new perspective on gravitational particle creation in cosmological settings."}

We develop a hybrid numerical framework to signify nonperturbative effects on the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background sourced by primordial curvature perturbations, focusing on the acoustic channel (fluid motions). Fully general-relativistic, spherically symmetric simulations are used to extract nonperturbative sound-shell profiles from isolated curvature peaks; these profiles are then embedded into three-dimensional lattice evolutions of relativistic hydrodynamics coupled to transverse-traceless metric perturbations to compute the acoustic GW spectra. The acoustic signal has a peak frequency determined by the comoving shell thickness, and its amplitude is extremely sensitive to the mean comoving separation of peaks, scaling approximately as $R_{*c}^{-7}$. We find a robust causal low-frequency tail $\\propto k^{3}$, and the nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions can enhance the ultraviolet power. Comparing with SIGWs computed perturbatively from the same real-space configuration, we show that acoustic GWs can be amplified by an order of magnitude and display a peak shifted to a lower frequency in the large-amplitude regime. These results highlight the importance of nonperturbative effects for accurate predictions of stochastic GW signals induced from primordial curvature perturbations."}

We demonstrate that a natural one-parameter generalization to a quadratic model $\\sim L+L^2$ in the Lovelock invariant $L=R+\\fracα{4}{\\cal G}$ ($\\cal G$ is the Gauss--Bonnet term), can effectively resolve this minor tension. Scalar-tensor formulation of this theory yields an Einstein-frame Starobinsky-type scalar potential augmented by Gauss--Bonnet and derivative couplings, which modify the inflationary slow-roll dynamics. We show that a non-zero coupling $α$ for the Gauss-Bonnet term can shift $(n_s, r)$ along a trajectory that brings the predictions into better agreement with the ACT likelihood. We also find that $L+L^2$ gravity, in its scalar-tensor formulation, is equivalent to Higgs inflation coupled to the Gauss--Bonnet term, and belongs to the Horndeski/galileon class of modified gravities. This work establishes the quadratic $f(L)$ gravity as a compelling and physically motivated extension that preserves the successes of Starobinsky inflation while improving its fit to modern precision cosmological data."}

By classifying these spacetimes into three fundamental types, Type I (Kretschmann scalar K_max increasing with mass M), Type II (mass-independent K_max), and Type III (K_max decreasing with M), we demonstrate how subtle variations in the core geometry imprint distinguishable features on the BH shadow. A detailed analysis of photon dynamics reveals that the parameters α and n, which control the deviation from Schwarzschild geometry and the radial decay of the regularizing factor, respectively, systematically alter the properties of the photon sphere. These intrinsic geometric differences propagate outward: for fixed parameters, Type III BHs, with the most compact photon sphere, produce the smallest and brightest shadows, whereas Type I BHs yield the largest and dimmest ones. Shadow computations under both static and infalling spherical accretion models confirm that the curvature-based classification directly corresponds to observable differences. Critically, Type III BHs exhibit the strongest sensitivity to parameter variations, making them optimal probes for constraining the underlying spacetime geometry. Our work reveals that even among nonsingular BHs sharing the same asymptotic core, differences in internal curvature are reflected in the shadow morphology, thereby providing a new pathway to test quantum-gravity-inspired models using upcoming high-resolution observations."}

The waveform modification is derived by incorporating the scalar charge correcting the fluxes and orbital trajectories of the secondary. Our results indicate that, under suitable parameter configurations, the influence of the scalar charge on EMRIs waveform in such environments can be distinguished from that in vacuum spacetime. For the EMRIs signal modified by the astrophysical environments, the future space-borne detector can determine the relative error of scalar charge constrained by LISA at the level of $\\sim0.1$, providing a preliminary prediction of detecting scalar charge in the beyond-vacuum spacetime."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Gravitational waves provide a unique window into gravity, cosmology, and high-energy physics, enabling the exploration of fundamental phenomena across a wide range of scales. This review presents a coherent and pedagogical framework that bridges foundational theory with observational frontiers. We begin by developing the theory of gravitational radiation within linearized general relativity, deriving gravitational waves as solutions to the linearized Einstein equations and clarifying their physical interpretation, polarization states, and key properties. We then deepen the discussion through a geometric perspective, tracing the connection between gravitational radiation and the algebraic structure of the Weyl tensor and its role in defining energy and angular momentum in asymptotically flat spacetimes. Extending beyond flat backgrounds, we examine gravitational waves in an expanding universe, following their evolution across cosmological epochs and their generation during inflation. Within this setting, we discuss adiabatic modes and consistency relations that reveal universal properties of long-wavelength perturbations, and derive the inflationary spectrum of vacuum gravitational waves together with their contribution to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. We also survey the main observational strategies for detecting gravitational waves across a broad frequency range, including cosmic microwave background polarization, pulsar timing arrays, ground- and space-based laser interferometers, and resonant cavity detectors. We then discuss the astrophysical and cosmological mechanisms responsible for generating gravitational radiation. We conclude by summarizing the current status of the field and outlining promising directions for future theoretical and observational developments."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "The pair-instability supernova (PISN) mechanism predicts a mass gap in the black hole population, where no stellar-origin black holes are expected to form. However, the binary black hole merger events GW190521 and GW231123 appear unusual, as current analyses place their component masses within the PISN mass gap. In this work, we investigate the relationship between different lensing magnifications and the inferred source-frame black hole masses for these two events. If the gravitational wave source is lensed, neglecting lensing effect can bias the inferred luminosity distance and hence the redshift, leading to an underestimation of the luminosity distance and consequently an overestimation of the source-frame masses, potentially placing them in the mass-gap region. For the two events in mass gap, when adopting a lower bound of $60 M_{\\odot}$ for the mass gap, the minimum magnifications required to shift the inferred source-frame masses below this gap boundary are found to be $μ=12.2$ for GW190521 and $μ=320.1$ for GW231123, corresponding to lensing-corrected luminosity distances of $11155\\, \\mathrm{Mpc}$ and $15207\\, \\mathrm{Mpc}$, respectively. These results provide a quantitative reference for assessing the lensing hypothesis as a possible explanation for the existence of black holes in the PISN mass gap."}

This implies that these two gravitational wave events might originate from the hierarchical merger mechanism, with at least one of the black holes being the remnant of a previous merger. Here we investigate the origin of hierarchical mergers for GW241011 and GW241110 using the merger entropy index which measures the efficiency of entropy transfer for binary black hole mergers in general relativity. We find that GW241011 is consistent with hierarchical mergers in dense star clusters. The origin of GW241110 remains under debate due to its large distribution uncertainty, which leads to method-dependent inference and should be taken into account when interpreting this event in terms of hierarchical mergers."}
