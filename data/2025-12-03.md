Abstract: Gravitational-wave data analysis relies on accurate and efficient methods to extract physical information from noisy detector signals, yet the increasing rate and complexity of observations represent a growing challenge. Deep learning provides a powerful alternative to traditional inference, but existing neural models typically lack the flexibility to handle variations in data analysis settings. Such variations accommodate imperfect observations or are required for specialized tests, and could include changes in detector configurations, overall frequency ranges, or localized cuts. We introduce a flexible transformer-based architecture paired with a training strategy that enables adaptation to diverse analysis settings at inference time. Applied to parameter estimation, we demonstrate that a single flexible model -- called Dingo-T1 -- can (i) analyze 48 gravitational-wave events from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Observing Run under a wide range of analysis configurations, (ii) enable systematic studies of how detector and frequency configurations impact inferred posteriors, and (iii) perform inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency tests probing general relativity. Dingo-T1 also improves median sample efficiency on real events from a baseline of 1.4% to 4.2%. Our approach thus demonstrates flexible and scalable inference with a principled framework for handling missing or incomplete data -- key capabilities for current and next-generation observatories.

Abstract: We propose an exceptional-point (EP) framework for black-hole ringdown beyond the standard quasinormal-mode (QNM) paradigm. It provides a first-principles characterization of the resonance associated with avoided crossings near EPs, an effect that conventional QNM analysis cannot fully capture. Employing a phenomenological environmental black-hole model with the hyperboloidal framework, we identify near-coalescence of both QNM eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, and directly demonstrate that the resonance produces enhanced mode contributions in the time domain, resulting in characteristic departures from exponentially damped oscillations. Our formulation further reveals that the EP frequency, given by the averaged value of the resonant modes, emerges as the physically relevant observable in the near-EP regime, and offers a robust foundation for modeling and extracting resonant ringdown signals.

Abstract: We address a long-standing misperception on the gravitational ``arrow of time'', a proposal by Penrose (also known as the ``Weyl-curvature hypothesis") that associates structure formation along timelike directions in which Weyl-curvature scalars become dominant over Ricci scalars. A counterexample of this hypothesis was found by Bonnor on a class of exact solutions describing heat conducting spheres collapsing in a Vaidya background. We show that this result does not hold in the same class of solutions considered as physically viable near FLRW cosmological models, with the heat conduction vector interpreted as a peculiar velocity field. We also discuss the similarities and differences between the gravitational ``arrow of time'' and the gravitational entropy formalism of Clifton, Ellis and Tavakol.

Abstract: In this work I use a frequency-domain Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli approach to compute the gravitational wave energy radiated by a compact body moving along a hyperbolic or parabolic geodesic of a Schwarzschild black hole. I compare my results with the latest post-Minkowskian (PM) calculations for the radiated energy and find agreement for hyperbolic orbits with large impact parameters and characterized by a velocity at infinity, $v_\infty$, as large as $v_\infty/c=0.7$. I also find agreement between my results and the leading-order PM expansion for the radiation absorbed by the black hole. I make further comparisons with post-Newtonian (PN) theory and show the effectiveness of a simple PN-PM hybrid model. Finally, I make a first comparison of the radiated energy between self-force and numerical relativity.

Abstract: The leading corrections to General Relativity can be parametrized by higher-derivative interactions in a low-energy effective field theory, in a way that is general and agnostic to the precise UV completion of gravity. Using pseudospectral methods, we compute the leading-order corrections to the Kerr metric across the entire range of sub-extremal values of spin and analyse their impact on physical quantities. We find that near-extremal black holes are most affected by the higher-derivative corrections, making them especially sensitive probes of new physics. A dataset of solutions and the code used to produce them are publicly available.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a new relativistic model for a charged anisotropic compact star in the framework of modified symmetric teleparallel gravity, namely $f(Q)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity. By employing the MIT bag model equation of state, we establish a relation between the metric potentials, leading to an exact solution of the field equations for an anisotropic fluid configuration coupled with a non-linear electromagnetic source. The interior spacetime is smoothly matched with the exterior geometry calculated from the theoretical setup of $f(Q)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity using the Darmois-Israel junction conditions, ensuring the continuity of the metric functions and their derivatives at the stellar boundary. The physical viability of the model is examined through regularity, energy, and causality conditions, all of which are satisfied throughout the stellar interior. The study highlights how the pressure anisotropy, the propagation speeds of sound, and the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff balance condition are interconnected, showing that the star remains in mechanical equilibrium only when the gravitational, hydrostatic, electric, and anisotropic contributions counterbalance one another appropriately. The dynamical stability of the configuration is further supported by the requirement $Γ> \tfrac{4}{3}$ for the adiabatic index, indicating resilience against small radial perturbations. The plots of compactness, surface redshift, and the mass--radius profiles confirm that all physical quantities behave regularly and vary smoothly throughout the stellar interior. We graphically plotted the mass-radius curves.

Abstract: We compute the tidal Love numbers for a particular axially symmetric configuration of extremal Reissner-Nordstrom geometry. By exactly solving the non-linear Einstein equations, we investigate the tidal response of extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black holes in four-dimensional spacetimes under external gravitational fields. We show that, for the specific geometry considered, the static tidal Love number remains finite and non-vanishing to all orders in the external tidal field. By contrast, we verify that the Love number of an isolated extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole remains zero, in agreement with previous expectations. Furthermore, we explicitly calculate the Zerilli-Moncrief master functions and match them with the effective field theory description.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate the axial electromagnetic quasinormal modes of a static, asymptotically Anti--de Sitter (AdS) black hole sourced by a nonlinear electrodynamics model of Plebański type. Starting from the master equation governing axial perturbations, we impose ingoing boundary conditions at the event horizon and normalizable (Dirichlet) behavior at the AdS boundary. Following the approach of Jansen, we recast the radial equation into a linear generalized eigenvalue problem by using an ingoing Eddington--Finkelstein formulation, compactifying the radial domain, and regularizing the asymptotic coefficients. The resulting problem is solved using a Chebyshev--Lobatto pseudospectral discretization. We compute the fundamental quasinormal mode frequencies for both the purely electric ($Q_m=0$) and purely magnetic ($Q_e=0$) sectors, emphasizing the role of the nonlinearity parameter $β$ and the effective charge magnitude $Q$. Our results show that increasing either $β$ or $Q$ raises both the oscillation frequency $ω_R$ and the damping rate $-ω_I$, leading to faster but more rapidly decaying ringdown profiles. Nonlinear electrodynamics breaks the isospectrality between electric and magnetic configurations: magnetic modes are systematically less oscillatory and more weakly damped than their electric counterparts. For sufficiently large $β$ and small $Q_m$, the fundamental mode becomes purely imaginary ($ω_R \approx 0$), in agreement with the absence of a trapping potential barrier in this regime. These findings reveal qualitative signatures of nonlinear electromagnetic effects on black hole perturbations and may have implications for high-field or high-charge astrophysical environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We develop a fully gauge-invariant and rigorously derived framework for computing the cumulative decoherence of gravitational waves (GWs) propagating through a stochastic quantum spacetime. Working directly with the Riemann-tensor two-point function and exploiting the extreme adiabaticity of cosmological GW propagation, we show that phase diffusion, rather than amplitude attenuation or mode mixing, is the unique leading-order imprint of microscopic curvature fluctuations. Our main theoretical result is a universality theorem: for any quantum-gravity model whose curvature fluctuations possess a finite correlation length, the accumulated phase variance grows linearly with distance, independent of the underlying microphysics. This diffusive scaling contrasts sharply with coherent astrophysical effects and with nonlocal models. The frequency exponent therefore becomes a clean spectral discriminator, separating string-foam recoil, holographic or scale-invariant noise, and causal-set discreteness. We obtain these results from first principles by evaluating the projected Riemann correlator along null geodesics and determining the exact conditions under which deviations from universality can arise. Finally, we outline a hierarchical Bayesian strategy for measuring this effect with LIGO, LISA, and Pulsar Timing Arrays. Although standard Planck-scale fluctuations remain far below current sensitivity, this framework provides a sharp and falsifiable test of exotic quantum-spacetime scenarios, particularly those with macroscopic correlation lengths or strong energy dependence.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Gibbons-Werner (GW) method provides a geometric framework for calculating the deflection angle of particles in curved spacetimes, and numerous extensions based on the original version have been developed in recent years to expand its applicability. Most existing studies, however, are restricted to unbound orbits. The finite-distance deflection angle, which assumes both the source and observer to be located at finite distances, motivates us to investigate the bending of bound orbits. In this work, we broaden the GW method to bound orbits of massive particles in stationary axisymmetric (SAS) spacetimes, following our previous extension in static spherically symmetric (SSS) backgrounds [Huang et al., Phys. Rev. D 107, 104046 (2023)]. By employing our generalized GW method for SAS spacetimes [Huang et al., J. Cosmol. Astropart. Phys. 01(2024)013], (a) We obtain a formula for the deflection angle of bound massive particles in SAS spacetimes by dividing bound orbits that azimuthally overlap with themselves into multiple non-overlapping segments. This division enables the application of the GW method -- originally developed for unbound orbits -- to each segment in a consistent manner. (b) We overcome the limitation associated with the loss of positive definiteness of the Jacobi-Maupertuis Randers-Finsler (JMRF) metric, which occurs because bound massive particles have energies below unity. To show the practical implementation of our approach, we carry out the calculation in Kerr spacetime and obtain the deflection angle between two arbitrary points along the bound orbit of massive particles.

Abstract: In the framework of $F(\mathcal{R},\tilde{\mathcal{R}})$ Einstein-Cartan gravity with an action depending both of the Ricci scalar and the so-called Holst-invariant curvature we consider models that include cubic terms of the latter in the action and study their inflationary behavior. These terms can have a considerable effect either positive or negative in relation to the agreement with present observational data, depending on parameters. In parameter regions where the quadratic models fail to produce results consistent with observational data, the presence of these additional cubic terms can lead to compatible predictions.

Abstract: This work investigates a cosmological model featuring an interaction between dark energy and dark matter, where the dark energy component is described by the Generalized Chaplygin-Jacobi gas (GCJG). In this study, we establish a system in which the GCJG and a pressureless dark matter fluid exchange energy via a linear interaction term, $Q \propto ρ_x$, being $ρ_{x}$ the dark energy density. By solving the conservation equations, we derive analytical expressions for the evolution of the dark energy and dark matter densities. The thermodynamic properties of this interacting system are then thoroughly analyzed. The thermodynamic analysis reveals that both dark components maintain positive temperatures, ensuring stability. Notably, the dark energy component transitions to a phantom regime in the past, a feature of interest for recent cosmological observations, without violating thermodynamic principles. The total entropy production is shown to be in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics. Furthermore, an analysis of the specific heats suggests that while the dark matter sector remains thermodynamically stable, the dark energy sector undergoes a late-time phase transition, consistent with its entering into the phantom domain at effective level.

Abstract: We investigate the orbital dynamics and gravitational-wave signatures of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in the spacetime of a Kerr black hole immersed in an asymptotically uniform magnetic field, described by the exact Kerr--Bertotti--Robinson (Kerr--BR) solution~\cite{Podolsky:2025tle}. In contrast to the widely used Kerr--Melvin metric, the Kerr--BR spacetime is of algebraic type~D, admits a clear asymptotic structure, and allows for a systematic analytic treatment of geodesics. By analyzing the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), we find that the external magnetic field consistently pushes the ISCO to larger radii \(r_{\rm ISCO}\) for all spin configurations considered. Counterintuitively, despite this outward radial shift, the ISCO orbital frequency \(Ω_{\rm ISCO}\) increases monotonically with the magnetic-field strength, leading to a robust ``blue-shift'' of the gravitational-wave cutoff frequency. We further show that retrograde orbits are significantly more sensitive to magnetic fields than prograde orbits, and identify a frequency crossover phenomenon in which magnetic corrections can invert the usual spin--frequency hierarchy at the ISCO. Finally, employing a semi-analytic adiabatic evolution scheme driven by exact geodesic relations and a leading-order quadrupole flux, we generate inspiral waveforms and quantify the substantial dephasing induced by the magnetic field. Our results indicate that large-scale magnetic environments can leave observable imprints in EMRI signals for future space-based detectors such as LISA, TianQin, and Taiji, and that neglecting such effects in waveform models may introduce non-negligible biases in parameter estimation, particularly for the black-hole spin.

Abstract: Gravitational lensing in the wave-optics regime imprints characteristic frequency-dependent amplitude and phase modulations on gravitational-wave (GW) signals, yet to be detected by ground-based interferometers. Similar modulations may also arise from orbital eccentricity, raising the possibility of degeneracies that could lead to false microlensing claims. We investigate the extent to which eccentric binary black hole (BBH) signals can mimic microlensing signatures produced by an isolated point-mass lens. With a simulated population of eccentric signals using numerical relativity simulations and \texttt{TEOBResumS-Dalí} waveform model, we perform a Bayesian model-comparison study, supported by a complementary \textit{mismatch} analysis. We find a strong degeneracy for high eccentricities, low total masses, and high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs): under these conditions, quasicircular microlensed model can be strongly favored over quasicircular unlensed model, even when the true signal is unlensed. For moderate SNRs ($\sim 30$), binaries with $M_\mathrm{tot}\lesssim 100\,M_\odot$ and eccentricity $e \gtrsim 0.4$ are particularly susceptible to misclassifications. In such cases, inferred microlens parameters exhibit well-constrained posteriors despite being unphysical. Crucially, the degeneracy is completely removed when the recovery uses waveform models that incorporate eccentricity, which overwhelmingly favors the eccentric hypothesis over microlensing. Our results demonstrate that any event exhibiting strong Bayesian evidence for microlensing should also be analyzed with eccentric waveform models and vice-versa to avoid false positives and biased astrophysical inference. This work contributes to developing robust strategies for interpreting signals in the era of precision GW astronomy.

Abstract: The existence of a fundamental zero-point length, $l_0$, a minimal spacetime scale predicted by T-duality in string theory or quantum gravity theories, modifies the entropy associated with the horizon of spacetime. In the cosmological setup, this leads to correction to the Friedmann equations governing the evolution of the Universe. In this paper, we investigate the implications of zero-point length $l_0$-corrected gravity for gravitational baryogenesis and early universe thermodynamics, deriving constraints on $l_0$ from observational baryon asymmetry data. We observe that under the condition of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, $l_0$ generates $\dot{\mathcal{R}}\neq 0$ during radiation epoch, where $\mathcal{R}$ is the Ricci scalar. This yields a baryon asymmetry parameter $η\propto l_0^2 T_D^9/M_{\rm Pl}^7$. The observed baryon asymmetry $η\sim 9.9 \times 10^{-11}$ constrains $l_0 \lesssim 7.1 \times 10^{-33} m$, approximately $440$ times the Planck length. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the zero-point length correction in the Friedmann equation, effectively slows the expansion rate at high energies, resulting in a modified time-temperature relationship where the Universe maintains higher temperatures for longer time during early epochs compared to standard cosmology. Our results establish zero-point length cosmology as a testable framework connecting quantum gravity to cosmological observables, with implications for early universe thermal history and fundamental length scales.

Abstract: We study the structural and dynamical consequences of introducing a distributional density profile inside a neutron star, representing a massless, topological shell located at an arbitrary radius. We incorporate this effect into the structure of neutron star and construct equilibrium sequence for several realistic equations of state. Radial stability is examined through the Sturm-Liouville formulation of the $\ell=0$ perturbation equation, supplemented with a jump condition and imprinting distinct features on the fundamental $f$-mode spectrum. We find strong, non-monotonic variations in the mode frequency relative to standard no-shell models. Using first-principles scaling relations, we estimate various gravitational wave observables such as the damping time, quality factor, luminosity and characteristic strain. These observables are then compared with the sensitivity of Advanced LIGO, and third-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. Our results demonstrate that internal topological shells can leave potentially observable signatures in the oscillation and gravitational wave properties of neutron stars.

Abstract: We investigate the challenges of constructing neutron star (NS) solutions in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity, highlighting the importance of treating the affine connection as an active, dynamical component of the theory. We begin by clarifying under what conditions standard simplifications -such as the coincident gauge or General Relativity (GR)-like connections- inadvertently lead to GR behavior, even in non-trivial $f(\mathbb{Q})$ models. Building on previous work in black hole (BH) spacetimes, we adapt the formalism to NS and extend it to non-vacuum configurations. Focusing on two representative models, $f(\mathbb{Q}) = \mathbb{Q} + α\mathbb{Q}^2$ and $f(\mathbb{Q}) = \mathbb{Q}^β$, our analysis suggests that, under standard regularity assumptions, solutions with Maclaurin/Laurent-type series recover GR dynamics, pointing to more intricate structures as the likely seat of beyond-GR effects, and reflecting the constraints imposed by the connection's dynamics on the asymptotic behavior of genuinely beyond-GR solutions. We then formulate the problem as a boundary value problem (BVP) and highlight the numerical pathologies that may arise, together with possible strategies to prevent them. This work aims to provide a concrete framework for future numerical studies and outlines the theoretical consistency conditions required to construct physically meaningful beyond-GR NS solutions in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity.

Abstract: Lunar laser ranging (LLR) currently delivers mm-class tests of relativistic gravity and the lunar interior, but further gains are limited by photon-starved pulsed systems, array-induced pulse broadening, and atmospheric variability. Pushing into the sub-0.1mm regime is required to probe ultra-slow tidal dissipation, long-period librations, uHz-band gravitational waves. We develop a complete amplitude-modulated continuous-wave (AM-CW) framework for high-power LLR, including measurement models, estimators, a unified covariance description, and an observatory CONOPS. CW LLR is treated as RF phase metrology on a bright CW optical carrier: 2-way range and 1-way line-of-sight range-rate obtained from the phase and phase slope of a GHz-class modulation tone. The joint estimators are characterized by a covariance matrix decomposed into photon, atmospheric, instrumental, oscillator, nonlinearity contributions, mapped into subsystem requirements, including a closed-form range-rate bias from modulation-frequency slew across the ~2.56s round trip and synthetic-wavelength constraints on multi-tone nonlinearity. Using realistic photon budgets for a 1 kW, 1064 nm CW transmitter on a 1-m telescope ranging to 10cm corner-cube retroreflectors, we show that the photon-statistical floor for 2-way range at a GHz-class modulation frequency is at the level of a few-10 um in ~100s. With allocations to residual atmosphere and instrument, the resulting single-station 2-way precision is ~80 um, with range-rate sensitivities of ~0.1-1 um/s. Differential LLR between reflectors separated on the Moon by ~1000km can deliver 20-50 um and few (0.1-1) um/s differential range and range-rate. These precisions are realized across three representative regimes that span detected photon rates of (5-7) x 10^3-10^5 s^{-1} and are translated directly into hardware and CONOPS requirements for next-generation high-power AM-CW LLR.

Abstract: We explore the impact of "slow-light" radiative transfer - i.e., general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) calculations in which the simulated fluid evolves while light rays are propagating through it - in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) models of the M87 jet. Because the plasma in the jet-launching region is accelerated to relativistic velocities, and because the jet in M87 is nearly aligned with the line of sight (offset by ~17 degrees), a slow-light treatment is important for accurately modeling the observable structure. While fast-light images exhibit prominent helical or loop-shaped features in the jet - which we associate with narrow bundles of magnetic field lines - these features become stretched and smoothed-out in slow-light images. Our slow-light images instead exhibit a double-edged, cone-like morphology that is more consistent with observations of M87 than corresponding fast-light images. We find that the radius at which the plasma transitions from sub-relativistic to relativistic velocities is imprinted on slow-light images via a transition from loop-dominated at small distances from the black hole to edge-dominated at a larger distance, with the loop-edge transition occurring at larger distances for lower black hole spins. The jet image dynamics also vary with black hole spin, with low-spin models producing jets that exhibit substantial "wobbling", while high-spin models produce jets that are straighter and more stable in time. The spin-dependent jet morphology and variability are revealed by slow-light imaging because slow-light effects become more enhanced as the plasma velocity becomes more relativistic, and because the plasma acceleration is itself a strong function of the spin.

Abstract: We present global 3D GRMHD simulations of black hole (BH) accretion disks designed to investigate how MRI-driven dynamo action regulates jet formation and evolution. Unlike standard SANE/MAD setups that impose a coherent large-scale poloidal loop, our "sub-SANE" initial conditions use multiple same-polarity small-scale magnetic loops. Rapid reconnection erases magnetic memory and enables large-scale dynamo to emerge early from MRI turbulence. We perform two such sub-SANE simulations at different BH spins ($a = 0.5, 0.9375$) and compare them with conventional SANE runs. The sub-SANE disks show regular large-scale dynamo cycles with periods of about ten orbits. Decomposition of the induction equation shows that the turbulent dynamo term is stronger in 3D compared to 2.5D and balances advection in the saturated state, confirming sustained large-scale field generation. These dynamo-generated fields are advected inward with minimal time lag, producing correlated peaks in both poloidal and toroidal field strengths from $r_{\rm max}$ to the horizon. Early in the evolution, these peaks imprint directly onto the jet's electromagnetic energy flux, indicating that the jet mirrors the dynamo wave. Though jets form at early times, the sub-SANE runs eventually undergo jet shutdown. We show that this occurs when the magnetic field at the horizon loses coherence, as quantified by a decline in the signed-to-unsigned flux ratio $\mathcal{C}_{\rm BH}$ below $\approx 0.6$. In contrast, the SANE reference case with similar accretion rate and horizon magnetic flux maintains high magnetic coherence because its initial large-scale field persists, allowing its jet to survive. Our results show that both dynamo-driven field evolution and horizon magnetic-field coherence critically regulate jet longevity, establishing a direct dynamo-jet connection in GRMHD disks.

Abstract: EP240222a is the first intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) tidal disruption event (TDE) captured in real-time with multi-wavelength observations and spectroscopic confirmation. However, its light curves deviate substantially from previous theoretical expectations. Motivated by these unique features, we have developed a novel model that successfully reproduces its peculiar evolution. Our model delineates five stages: (1) Initial Stage of inefficient circularization; (2) Slow-Rising Stage with a faint X-ray precursor disk fed by successive self-crossings; (3) Fast-Rising Stage, where delayed stream-disk interaction at momentum flux matching drives a sharp luminosity rise; (4) Plateau Stage with super-Eddington accretion, outflow, reprocessing, and a clear polar line-of-sight; and (5) Decline Stage of sub-Eddington accretion and ongoing reprocessing. Our fit indicates the disruption of a $M_* \approx 0.4~M_\odot$ main-sequence (MS) star with a penetration factor $β\approx 1.0$. Our model, which incorporates key TDE processes, establishes EP240222a-like light curves as typical IMBH-TDE signatures. The distinctive identifier is a slow rise in X-rays and a corresponding slow rise/quasi-plateau in the UV/optical, followed by a brighter, super-Eddington plateau in both bands, though other forms exist, such as the rapid rise from white dwarf (WD) disruptions over minutes to days.

Abstract: To investigate the impact of nuclear reaction rate uncertainties on type I X-ray burst nucleosynthesis, comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations are performed with temperature-independent and -dependent variations in reaction rates using the REACLIB and STARLIB libraries, respectively. A total of 1,711 $(p, γ)$, $(p, α)$, $(α, p)$, and $(α, γ)$ reactions are varied simultaneously, along with their inverse reactions, via detailed balance. For the first time, it is found that Monte Carlo sampling with larger perturbations to these reaction rates may lead to multi-peaked abundance distributions for some isotopes. These multi-peak structures arise not only from coupled reactions but also, in some cases, from single reactions. Our study also confirmed previously identified key reactions and provides more robust lists. These reactions deserve priority consideration in future study.

Abstract: The formation channels of binary neutron stars (BNSs) remain uncertain. The detection of GW190425 by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) suggests a subpopulation of massive BNSs, possibly formed through unstable "case BB" mass transfer with short merger delays. We investigate whether next-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) can identify and characterise such subpopulations. Using the latest LVK constraints on the BNS merger rate, we generate mock ET catalogues containing a mixture of light and heavy subpopulations. The redshift distribution of each subpopulation is modeled as the convolution of the cosmic star formation rate with a time-delay distribution: heavy BNSs have fixed short delays, while light BNSs follow power-law delays with indices -0.5,-1,-1.5. Hierarchical Bayesian analyses are then performed on catalogues of 100-5,000 events. With hundreds of detections from ET, we will be able to establish that the total mass distribution is bimodal. A few thousand events are sufficient to disentangle the redshift distributions of the two subpopulations for moderate time-delay indices (-0.5 or -1). For steeper indices (-1.5), the differences are more subtle, requiring larger catalogues, beyond what we could explore given our computational resources. Next-generation detectors should enable the detection of multiple BNS subpopulations and their redshift evolution, providing valuable insight into their formation pathways.

Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have become an indispensable tool for studying the Universe's ionisation properties, as well as its cosmological parameters. This is achieved by analysing their diffuse dispersion measure (${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$) as a function of redshift. However, this requires an integration along the line-of-sight, which is time-consuming. In this work, we derive an analytical approximation formula for ${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$ for flat, $Λ$CDM and $w$CDM universes. We show that our approximation works well for the ranges $0.01 \leq z \leq 2$, $0.2 \leq Ω_m \leq 1.0$ and $-3.0 \leq w \leq -0.5$, with relative fractional error to a numerically evaluated ${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$ always smaller than $3.5\ \%$, in the worst case scenario, and in most cases smaller than $0.5\ \%$. Moreover, the approximation is more than $15$ ($2$) times faster than the numerical solution of $Λ$CDM ($w$CDM). Therefore, we hope that it could be a useful tool for the FRB community.

Abstract: M31 UCXB-1 is one of the brightest X-ray point sources in the bulge of M31, with a peak X-ray luminosity $ L_{\mathrm{0.5-10 \: keV}} = 2.9^{+0.2}_{-0.2} \times 10^{38} \: \mathrm{erg} \: \mathrm{s}^{-1} $. Both XMM-Newton and Chandra observations have detected an eclipsing signal with a period of about 465 seconds from this source, and we note that the periodic signal is detected exclusively during the source's high-luminosity states. This signal probably originates from its orbital motion, therefore it is an ultra-compact X-ray binary (UCXB) candidate with the highest X-ray luminosity. Our theoretical analyses show that M31 UCXB-1 is in good agreement with the luminosity-orbital period relation ($ L_{\mathrm{2-10 \: keV}}-P_{\mathrm{orb}} $) of the black hole/neutron star--white dwarf (BH/NS--WD) UCXB system. Moreover, our spectral analyses indicate that the primary in M31 UCXB-1 is more likely to be a BH rather than an NS. The results show that M31 UCXB-1 is a BH--WD system, with the shortest orbital period, the possibly strongest gravitational wave emission, and the most massive white dwarf among the known UCXBs.

Abstract: It has been suggested that there are $\sim 10^5$ black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) binaries in our Galaxy. However, despite the effort of intensive radio search for decades, none of these binaries has been found to date. These binaries are regarded as a holy grail of astronomy because they can greatly improve our understanding about relativistic systems of compact objects and fundamental physics. In this article, we propose the existence of exotic BH-NS binaries which can open a new way in searching the missing BH-NS binaries in our Galaxy. By considering the possible dark matter density spikes formed around the primordial black holes in the BH-NS binaries, we show that extremely high temperature ($\sim 10^6$ K) could be maintained on the surface of the neutron stars due to effective dark matter capture. This interesting feature can also help reveal the nature of dark matter and possibly further improve the upper limit of dark matter scattering cross section well below $10^{-47}$ cm$^2$.

Abstract: The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) has recently reported five Galactic microquasars as Ultra-High-Energy (UHE) $γ$-ray emitters (> 100 TeV). Among these sources, the microquasar V4641 Sgr exhibits $γ$-ray emission up to $\sim$0.8 PeV, requiring the acceleration of particles to multi-PeV energies, as well as the hardest UHE spectrum. The mechanisms behind particle acceleration to such energies are not well understood. Furthermore, the limited multi-wavelength (MWL) information on this source appears contradictory, further complicating interpretation and suggesting that V4641 Sgr may represent a particularly unusual case. In this work, we present a detailed physical model of V4641 Sgr that combines first-principles simulations of stochastic (turbulent) particle acceleration with MWL emission modeling. We adopt a leptonic scenario in which electrons are accelerated via the second-order Fermi process driven by relativistic strong turbulence ($δB/B \sim 1$). The particle energization is simulated using a dedicated Monte Carlo framework STRIPE that incorporates the effects of intermittent energy gains and radiative losses. The resulting accelerated electrons produce UHE $γ$-rays through inverse Compton scattering on both the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the interstellar radiation fields (ISRF). Our model is capable of reproducing key observational characteristics of the system, including particle acceleration to energies of tens of PeV, as well as the TeV-PeV $γ$-ray spectrum and the hard spectral index measured by LHAASO. Nonetheless, several aspects remain unresolved, highlighting the need for deeper observational coverage and further theoretical refinement.

Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are energetic radio bursts that typically last for milliseconds. They are mostly of extragalactic origin, but the progenitors, trigger mechanisms and radiation processes are still largely unknown. Here we present a comprehensive analysis on 415 non-repeating FRBs detected by CHIME, applying manual filtering to ensure sample completeness. It is found that the distribution of fluence can be approximated by a three-segment power-law function, with the power-law indices being $-3.76 \pm 1.61$, $0.20 \pm 0.68$ and $2.06 \pm 0.90$ in the low, middle, and high fluence segments, respectively. Both the total dispersion measure (\text{DM}) and the extragalactic \text{DM} follow a smoothly broken power-law distribution, with characteristic break DM values of $\sim 703$ pc $\rm cm^{-3}$ and $\sim 639$ pc $\rm cm^{-3}$, respectively. The redshifts are estimated from the extragalactic \text{DM} by using the Macquart relation, which are found to peak at $ z \sim 0.6$. The isotropic energy release ($E_{\text{iso}}$) is also derived for each burst. Two-Gaussian components are revealed in the distribution of $E_{\text{iso}}$, with the major population narrowly clustered at $\sim 2.3 \times 10^{40} {\rm erg}$. The minor population have a characteristic energy of $\sim 1.6 \times 10^{39}$ erg and span approximately one order of magnitude. The distribution hints a near-uniform energy release mechanism for the dominant population as expected from some catastrophic channels, whereas the lower-energy component (potentially including repeat-capable sources) may reflect a broader diversity in FRB origins, emission mechanisms and evolutionary stages.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The cosmological distribution and formation rate of compact astrophysical objects such as fast radio bursts (FRBs) are typically assumed to be proportional to a linear combination of cosmological star formation rate and stellar mass. In the literature, a template for star formation rate, which is just a function of redshift, is typically used. In this work, we point out the importance of galaxy stellar mass function which captures the host galaxy information of observed FRBs as well as the redshift evolution of galaxy stellar mass. Using this information, we find that FRB formation efficiency per stellar mass has to be more efficient (by a factor of $\approx 3$) than previously calculated, in order to reproduce the observed volumetric rate of FRBs at $z=0$. We show that cosmological population studies of FRBs have to include host galaxy information along with its redshift evolution in order to obtain unbiased results. This consideration is also applicable to other transients, e.g. gamma-ray bursts and merging binary black hole events. We show that our approach may open up the possibility to infer the host galaxy stellar mass of merging binary black holes with a detection of few thousand gravitational wave events.

Abstract: Blazars are promising targets for neutrino astronomy, as highlighted by IceCube's identification of TXS 0506+056 as a cosmic neutrino source candidate. High-frequency-peaked BL Lacs (HBLs) stand out due to their characteristic electromagnetic high-energy emission properties, which makes them as well promising candidates for the production of high-energy neutrinos. Such neutrinos could be detected by KM3NeT/ARCA, a next-generation deep-sea Cherenkov detector under construction in the Mediterranean Sea. This contribution presents the results of a binned likelihood stacking analysis investigating high-energy neutrino emissions from a subset of HBLs. A total of 232 sources have been selected from the 3HSP catalogue and targeted in the analysis of KM3NeT/ARCA data taken with several detector configurations, specifically in the period in which from 6 to 21 detection units were deployed. The analysis is based on neutrino emission models of blazars developed using the LeHa-Paris numerical code, which simulates the spectral energy distribution of jetted active galactic nuclei.

Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio pulses originating from cosmological distances, as indicated by their large dispersion measures. While numerous FRBs have now been localised to their host galaxies, a distinct class of compact electromagnetic counterpart, a Persistent Radio Source (PRS), has also been identified in some cases. Currently, only three, and possible a fourth repeating FRBs (FRB20121102A, FRB20190417A, FRB20190520B, and FRB20240114A) have confirmed associations with a PRS. Insight into progenitors, local environments, and the evolution of FRBs can be clarified by characterising these PRSs. In this work, we present 2 detected candidate PRSs using MeerKAT radio telescope data and one non-detection (as part of a larger study involving 25 FRB positions). Both FRB20221106 and FRB20181112 were found to have a host galaxy, and whether the detected radio continuum emission comes from the host galaxy or PRS is still an open question. High-resolution observations from a telescope such as e-MERLIN are required to resolve this question. If a compact PRS is detected, this telescope will provide the size, and investigate the flux variability and spectral shape of this compact PRS. Lastly, in the case of FRB220190102, which was observed over two epochs, no radio continuum was detected. However, a flux upper limit is provided for both epochs.

Abstract: Very high-energy (VHE) detected flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) are relatively few despite being the most persistent bright MeV-GeV sources. Focusing on VHE emission, we investigated the spectral and temporal properties of VHE-detected FSRQs using 14-year Fermi-LAT data. All are highly variable (flux-amplitude$>$100) with VHE detection associated with brighter flux states and relatively harder spectra. Above a flux limit, flux anti-correlates with spectral index, exhibiting a bluer-when-brighter trend. The low-flux state spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for all resembles a power-law, while high-flux and VHE-associated states resemble a log-parabola, accompanied by an almost nil (PKS0736+017, PKS1510-089) to marginal (4C+21.35, 3C279) to significant (B21420+32, TON0599, PKS1441+25, S30218+35, PKS0346-27, OP313) MeV-GeV peak-upshift -- more prominent in high-redshift sources. For no/marginal peak-upshift, the VHE emission is consistent with external Comptonization of infrared photons (EC-IR) driven primarily by a power-law continuation of the particle spectrum to higher energies. For those with a significant MeV-GeV peak-upshift, PKS0346-27 and OP313 shows peak-upshift in the synchrotron spectrum, and thus VHE is EC-IR origin, while for others without synchrotron-peak upshift, we attribute the VHE to an HBL-like component with a Compton-Dominance (CD) like FSRQs, with VHE driven primarily by particle spectrum continuation. In some, even high-state SEDs seem to require an HBL-like component. Thus, VHE activities in FSRQs mainly result from particle spectrum continuation, aided by spectral transition or a new HBL-like component with FSRQ-like CD. Such spectral changes naturally brighten the GeV-VHE flux, overcoming extragalactic background light absorption without requiring extraordinary brightening under the traditional EC-IR scenario than normally exhibited.

Abstract: High-energy astrophysical sources such as active galactic nuclei, quasars, X-ray binaries, and gamma-ray bursts are powered by mechanisms that convert gravitational or rotational energy into radiation, jets, and relativistic outflows. Understanding the physics of these processes remains a major challenge. Black holes have traditionally served as the central engines behind such phenomena, with well established energy extraction mechanisms including the Penrose process, the Blandford-Znajek process, and the Banados-Silk-West mechanism. However, studies in general relativity indicate that, under certain conditions, gravitational collapse may lead to the formation of naked singularities or other horizonless compact objects, which could in principle allow more efficient energy extraction than classical black holes. This brief review summarizes recent progress on energy extraction mechanisms in naked singularity spacetimes. We examine the roles of rotation, electromagnetic fields, and particle interactions in shaping extraction efficiency and dynamics. Particular attention is given to negative energy orbits and ergoregion physics, which enable Penrose type and magnetic Penrose mechanisms without an event horizon. We also discuss collisional Penrose processes and particle acceleration near the singularity, emphasizing their potential astrophysical implications. By comparing extraction efficiencies and physical conditions in black holes and naked singularities, we highlight how the absence of a horizon fundamentally alters the dynamics of energy release. These results suggest that naked singularities may serve as natural laboratories for strong field gravity and as alternative engines for high-energy astrophysical phenomena in the era of multi-messenger observations.

Abstract: The Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) is the accumulated light emitted throughout the history of the universe, spanning the UV, optical, and IR spectral ranges. Stars and dust in galaxies are expected to be the main source of the EBL. However, recent direct measurements performed beyond Pluto's orbit (less affected by foregrounds than those performed from the Earth) hint at an EBL level in the optical band larger than the one expected from the integrated contribution of known galaxy populations. One approach that could solve this controversy uses Very High Energy (VHE) photons coming from sources at cosmological distances. These photons can interact with the EBL producing electron-positron pairs, a process that leaves an imprint on the observed VHE spectrum. This technique, however, requires assumptions on the intrinsic spectrum of the source, which can compromise the robustness of EBL constraints. In this contribution, we used Monte Carlo simulations and archival data of the MAGIC telescopes to study the impact that the assumptions adopted in the literature have on the estimate of the EBL density, and how using more generic ones would modify the results. Our results show how the EBL density constraints obtained highly depend on the intrinsic spectral shape assumed for the source. We have studied two different methods to reduce the assumptions on the intrinsic spectral shape to get more robust results. This will be especially important for upcoming with new VHE facilities, where systematic uncertainties are expected to play a more significant role compared to statistical ones.
