Abstract: Gradual crustal deformation can generate strongly twisted magnetic fields around magnetars, potentially triggering giant flares with total energies exceeding $10^{44}\,\mathrm{erg}$. In this Letter, we present the first relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a surface shear-driven magnetar eruption, capturing reconnection-driven plasma heating, the ejection of relativistically hot plasma, and the formation of a hot fireball confined within the inner magnetosphere. We find that magnetic reconnection in the equatorial current sheet launches a hot trailing outflow capable of powering the initial spike observed in giant flares, while simultaneously leaving behind a thermally stratified fireball with sufficient thermal energy to produce the pulsating, decaying tail. Together, these features provide a self-consistent physical framework for understanding the observed energetics of magnetar giant flares. The eruption also expels a magnetically dominated giant plasmoid carrying up to $\sim 9\%$ of the magnetosphere's total magnetic energy. Furthermore, our simulation demonstrates how the plasmoid drives the formation of a blast wave -- an important ingredient in models linking magnetar eruptions to fast radio bursts.

Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of cosmic-ray propagation using the time-dependent AMS-02 flux measurements covering a full solar cycle, with particular emphasis on the role of solar modulation. We fit two representative Galactic propagation scenarios, convection- and re-acceleration-dominated models, in combination with three solar modulation prescriptions: the standard force-field approximation, an extended force-field model with a rigidity break, and the heliospheric propagation code $\texttt{HelMod}$. The inclusion of time-resolved antiproton data provides a unique probe of charge-sign-dependent modulation effects and low-energy systematics. We find that the force-field approximation can describe positively charged nuclei reasonably well outside the solar maximum in convection-dominated models, but fails during periods of high solar activity and for antiprotons at all times. In re-acceleration scenarios, strong degeneracies between solar modulation and low-energy propagation lead to unphysical results when simple modulation models are employed. Across all models, we identify systematic uncertainties of order 10-15% in the reconstructed local interstellar spectra and propagation parameters, driven by limitations in current solar modulation modelling. Compared to the percent level error of current measurements, these uncertainties significantly limit the precision of cosmic-ray studies. Future time-dependent measurements spanning a full 22-year solar cycle will be crucial to reduce these uncertainties.

Abstract: The Equation of State (EoS) of dense nuclear matter remains one of the most compelling open questions in high-energy astrophysics. While static EoS models are increasingly well-constrained by observations of binary neutron star (BNS) inspirals, the possibility of a dynamic phase transition occurring during the coalescence has been thus far deferred from standard gravitational-wave (GW) analyses. In this work, we investigate the detectability of such a phase transition, manifesting as a macroscopic shift in the tidal deformability parameter $Λ$, using GWs from Neutron Star-Black Hole (NSBH) coalescences. We argue that NSBH systems serve as a cleaner laboratory for this phenomenology than BNS systems due to the absence of the $\tildeΛ(Λ_1,Λ_2)$ degeneracy, allowing for the isolation of single-body tidal evolution. We introduce a phenomenological waveform model, TROYE (Transitional Representation Of varYing Equation-of-state), which stitches together two waveform approximants in the time domain to simulate a smooth but rapid transition between two equations of state during the late inspiral. We perform a comprehensive Bayesian injection and recovery campaign on 100 simulated events using the bilby inference library. Our results demonstrate that a phase transition corresponding to a tidal shift of $|ΔΛ| \gtrsim 400$ is detectable with Advanced LIGO design sensitivity, yielding decisive statistical evidence ($\ln B > 5$). We further identify a "V-shape" asymmetry in detectability, where "softening" transitions (decreasing $Λ$) are systematically easier to detect than "stiffening" ones due to the specific phase evolution of the tidal sector. Finally, we present "stress tests" showing that the transition remains recoverable even when marginalized over uncertainties in the stitching time and binary mass ratio.

Abstract: The mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is commonly inferred from the first two moments of the depth of shower maximum, $X_{\rm max}$, measured by fluorescence and hybrid detectors. Such analyses require fast and accurate mappings between the moments of $X_{\rm max}$ and those of the logarithmic mass, $\ln A$, based on realistic air-shower simulations. In this work we provide updated parametrizations of the $X_{\rm max}$ moments and distributions for air showers initiated by nuclei from proton to iron, simulated with CONEX for three state-of-the-art hadronic interaction models: Epos LHC-R, Sibyll 2.3e, and QGSJet-III-01. We parametrize the mean depth $\langle X_{\rm max}\rangle$ and the variance $σ^2(X_{\rm max})$ as functions of energy and mass. For the variance we compare a second-order polynomial model with an exponential model. In addition, we model the full $X_{\rm max}$ distributions with a three-parameter generalized Gumbel function. The Gumbel parameters are fitted using an unbinned likelihood and are validated by comparing the implied mean and variance with the raw CONEX samples and with the moment parametrizations. Across the full energy range considered, residuals between the parametrizations (or the Gumbel representation) and the simulations are at the level of a few g cm$^{-2}$ for the mean and a few (g cm$^{-2}$)$^2$ for the variance, making these parametrizations suitable for precision UHECR composition studies and forward-folding analyses of $X_{\rm max}$ distributions.

Abstract: The existence of a distinct mass boundary between the heaviest neutron stars and the lightest black holes remains in question. It is an artefact of our ignorance of the properties of matter at supra-nuclear densities, which exist in the cores of neutron stars. The study addresses these problems with a physics-informed machine learning approach, guided by astrophysical observations. The Transformer model is trained on an agnostically generated ensemble of equations of state. Two geometric parameters are defined on the mass-radius sequence of a neutron star--the front bending and the back bending. The transformer provides a two-step solution: first, the model predicts the maximum mass and radius using the bending parameters. Second, it predicts the square of the sound speed profile, completing the inverse mapping. The prediction is that massive neutron stars form when the sound speed peaks at low density, leading to strong back-bending and an early phase transition to quark matter. Massive stars favour a stiff equation of state at low density, and the density of matter at the star's core is sufficiently small. The maximum mass for a neutron star predicted by the astrophysical constrained transformer model is $2.477$ solar masses, and a minimum radius of about $11.498$ km for a neutron star of $1.4$ solar masses.

Abstract: Previous numerical simulations have shown that cold clumps can form within hot accretion flows, offering insights into the detailed processes of the state transition in black hole X-ray binaries. However, the evolution of the cold clumps has not been investigated in detail yet. In this paper, we conduct hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the evolution of the cold clumps. In addition to previous result that when the accretion rate is high enough the cold clumps emerge within the hot accretion flow, we found that instead of directly moving toward to the black hole, the clumps moves outward when they initially form. The reason should be the combination of viscous torque and the condensation of hot gas from larger radii, which lead to the slightly super-Keplerian angular momentum of the clumps. After reaching the equilibrium position, the clumps begin to fragment at the inner edge with each fragment moving inward sequentially. Generally, the azimuthal movement of the clumps are quasi-Keplerian, being closer to the outer detached Keplerian cold disk rather than the surrounding sub-Keplerian hot accretion flow, which agrees well with the semi-analytical results for weak coupling case in Wang et al. (2012).

Abstract: We present X-ray proper motion (PM) measurements of 19 pulsars using new and archival data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, including pulsar wind trails and X-ray filaments. Precise X-ray PMs are often limited by uncertainties in aligning observations to a common reference frame. Our analysis uses unresolved X-ray flux from stars in the Gaia catalog in addition to X-ray bright point sources for alignment, improving uncertainties. We obtain absolute positions referenced to Gaia with typical astrometric precision $\sim$10 mas and PM statistical uncertainties down to 1.3 mas yr$^{-1}$, the most precise X-ray PM achieved to date. With our improved frame alignment, PM accuracies are now limited by the pulsar flux in most cases. These results reveal a new X-ray filament and illuminate the wind nebula structures and origins of several of these pulsars.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Modified gravity is often approached in the context of effective-field theory (EFT), with the view that the EFT corrections permit a more desirable theory. In this paper, we posit that this should extend to the causal structure of curved spacetime in addition to the standard demands such that of flat spacetime positivity and unitarity. We propose a new guiding principle for modified-gravity theories, namely that closed timelike curves should always be {\it harder} to obtain than in General Relativity. By demanding this, one can place powerful constraints on modified gravity. To elucidate this claim, we investigate modified-gravity EFTs on rotating black-hole backgrounds, focusing on the appearance/disappearance of closed timelike curves, and provide parameter bounds which only partly overlap with other approaches based on time delay. We construct perturbative rotating black-hole solutions in modified-gravity EFTs based on the Horndeski class and provide parameter bounds necessary to preserve causality and stability. Finally, we present a novel probe for the existence of closed timelike curves through quasinormal modes and black-hole echoes. This can be used to diagnose spacetime causality once next-generation gravitational-wave data becomes available.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Environmental effects such as hierarchical triple motion can introduce cumulative phase modulation in gravitational-wave signals through time-dependent line-of-sight acceleration. Whether such smooth time-warp distortions are observable depends jointly on deformation strength and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), yet this relationship has not been quantified in a template-free framework. We study the detectability of these distortions using time-frequency representations derived from the continuous wavelet transform. Instead of reconstruction error alone, we examine trajectory-based statistics, in particular the evolution of the power-weighted frequency centroid. We find that environmental modulation can be detected using a single-sample statistic referenced to an isolated-binary distribution, without requiring matched templates. Across a grid of cumulative phase distortions and SNR, detection performance collapses onto a single scaling parameter defined as the product of phase distortion and SNR. The ROC-AUC follows a sigmoid transition in this parameter. Moderate distortions are detectable at low SNR, whereas smaller distortions require higher SNR. These results indicate that smooth environmental phase modulation is not generically absorbed by intrinsic waveform variability; instead, detectability is governed by a simple scaling between cumulative phase distortion and signal strength.

Abstract: In this Letter, we show that, in contrast to Dyson shells surrounding uncharged compact objects, which are generally unstable, a neutral Dyson shell enclosing a charged compact object described by the Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime can attain a stable equilibrium configuration. We analytically derive the conditions for stability, determine the equilibrium radius and the corresponding minimum asymptotic energy, and show that small perturbations about this equilibrium lead to a stable oscillatory motion of the shell. The oscillation frequency is obtained explicitly and shown to increase with the shell mass and decrease with the charge of the central object. When the shell itself carries charge, its stability depends on the sign of this charge. Shells with the same sign as the central charge become progressively less stable, while oppositely charged shells exhibit enhanced stability due to the electrostatic attraction. These findings highlight the stabilizing role of electromagnetic interactions in Dyson-type thin-shell configurations within general relativity.

Abstract: We report an updated constraint on the Solar System quadrupole parameter $Q_2$, which encodes the external field effect predicted by modified gravity versions of the MOND paradigm. Using the dataset employed to compute the DE440 planetary ephemerides, and estimating it simultaneously with other parameters included in the planetary ephemerides, we find $Q_2 = (1.6 \pm 1.8) \times 10^{-27}\,\mathrm{s}^{-2}$ (1-$σ$), representing an improvement of 40% over previous estimates. We also show explicitly that the contribution to the MOND prediction of $Q_2$ from the Solar System's largest planet, Jupiter, is at the 0.05% level, validating the approximation of retaining only the Sun in theoretical calculations. With this new constraint on $Q_2$, we update previously acknowledged tensions with external galaxy rotation curves, now leading to discrepancies at the $3$-$15σ$ level depending on the detailed mass modeling or the subset of galaxies considered. Within the Milky Way itself, the $Q_2$ constraint imposes an upper bound of only 2% (at 95% confidence) on the MOND boost to the galactic radial acceleration (i.e., the ratio of the observed over baryonic Newtonian acceleration) at the position of the Sun, in strong tension with current observational limits. The updated $Q_2$ posterior finally confirms that Solar System measurements provide stronger constraints than current wide-binary data on classical modified gravity versions of MOND.

Abstract: We investigate the cosmological dynamics of FHDE within $f(T)$ gravity by employing the dynamical system approach in a spatially flat FRW background. By introducing appropriate dimensionless variables, the field equations are reformulated as a closed system, which allows a systematic phase-space analysis. The resulting system admits four critical points, including two saddle points corresponding to radiation and matter-dominated epochs, and two stable points associated with a DE-dominated phase and a de Sitter solution. The radiation- and matter-dominated critical points are found to possess a saddle character in phase space, ensuring their transient nature and enabling the cosmological evolution to naturally progress toward a stable late-time accelerated attractor. The stable critical points describe accelerated expansion with effective equations of state compatible with DE and de Sitter regimes. Overall, the analysis indicates that $f(T)$ gravity is capable of reproducing the standard cosmological sequence within a consistent dynamical framework.

Abstract: We discuss the possibility of a simultaneous cosmic variation of two fundamental entities: the Newtonian gravitational coupling $G$ and the electron mass $m_e$. We show that this variation can account for the late-time cosmic acceleration without invoking a cosmological constant or an explicit dark-energy fluid. We compare the derived $m_e$ variation with laboratory bounds found from Quasar absorption Spectra. Our results indicate that late-time cosmic acceleration could be a manifestation of evolving fundamental couplings, establishing a direct bridge between precision tests of gravity, particle physics and the origin of cosmic acceleration.

Abstract: We present \textbf{warpax}, an open-source, GPU-accelerated Python toolkit for observer-robust energy condition analysis of warp drive spacetimes. Existing tools evaluate energy conditions for a finite sample of observer directions; \textbf{warpax} replaces discrete sampling with continuous, gradient-based optimization over the timelike observer manifold (rapidity and boost direction), backed by Hawking--Ellis algebraic classification. At Type~I stress-energy points, which comprise ${>}\,96$\% of all grid points across the tested metrics, an algebraic eigenvalue check determines energy-condition satisfaction \emph{exactly}, independent of any observer search or rapidity cap. At non-Type~I points the optimizer provides rapidity-capped diagnostics. Stress-energy tensors are computed from the ADM metric via forward-mode automatic differentiation, eliminating finite-difference truncation error. Geodesic integration with tidal-force and blueshift analysis is also included.
  We analyze five warp drive metrics (Alcubierre, Lentz, Van~Den~Broeck, Natário, Rodal) and one warp shell metric (used primarily as a numerical stress test). For the Rodal metric, the standard Eulerian-frame analysis misses violations at over $28\%$ of grid points (dominant energy condition) and over $15\%$ (weak energy condition). Even where the Eulerian frame identifies the correct violation set, observer optimization reveals that violation severity can be orders of magnitude larger (e.g.\ Alcubierre weak energy condition: ${\sim}\,90{,}000\times$ at rapidity cap $ζ_{\max} = 5$, scaling as $e^{2ζ_{\max}}$). These results demonstrate that single-frame evaluation can systematically underestimate both the spatial extent and the magnitude of energy condition violations in warp drive spacetimes. \textbf{warpax} is freely available at https://github.com/anindex/warpax.

Abstract: We present general-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of binary neutron star mergers performed with GR-Athena++. Neutrino transport is treated using a moment-based, energy-integrated scheme (M1), augmented by neutrino number density evolution (N0). Our implementation is validated through an extensive suite of standard tests and demonstrated to perform robustly under adaptive mesh refinement. As a first application, we simulate the gravitational collapse of a uniformly rotating, magnetized neutron star, demonstrating stable radiation evolution through apparent-horizon formation using a novel excision technique based on the tapering of state vector evolution inside the horizon. To further test robustness in highly dynamic environments, we apply our code to two demanding binary neutron star merger scenarios. We investigate a long-lived remnant with the DD2 equation of state, evolved with full general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and M1 neutrino transport. Following this, a gravitational collapse scenario with the SFHo equation of state is explored. We showcase long-term stable evolution on neutrino cooling time-scales, demonstrating robust handling of excision and stable evolution of the post-collapse accretion phase in three-dimensional mergers with magnetic fields and neutrino radiation.

Abstract: We establish a new SU(N) symmetric model of interaction between the fields of four types: the multiplet of vector fields, which describes the so-called color aether, the multiplet of pseudoscalar fields, which is associated with the multi-component cosmic dark matter, the gauge and gravitational fields. The extended Lagrangian of the model contains a new constructive element, which is based on the covariant SU(N) symmetric divergence of the multiplet of vector fields; this new element, being the multiplet of scalars from the point of view of spacetime transformations and the color vector from the point of view of the SU(N) group space, gives us the possibility to formulate properly the multi-axionic extension of the Peccei-Quinn theory. The hypothesis of a spontaneous polarization of the multi-axionic color aether in the early Universe is presented. The set of self-consistent master equations of the model is derived. An application to cosmology is considered: the obtained master equations are solved for the truncated test model based on the Bianchi-I spacetime platform.

Abstract: The possibility of detecting solar oscillation modes using space-based gravitational-wave detectors has been investigated in the context of gravitational-wave interferometry, with Polnarev \cite{Polnarev:2009xf} demonstrating that low-frequency solar modes could, in principle, produce detectable signals in a LISA-type interferometer. Motivated by this work, I revisit the problem using current solar models, updated detector sensitivities, and improved theoretical and observational constraints on mode amplitudes. In this study, I compute the gravitational response of solar oscillation modes using standard solar models generated with \texttt{MESA}, and mode eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions calculated with \texttt{GYRE}. I focus primarily on solar $g$ modes, evaluating their responses for degree $l=2$ and azimuthal orders $m=0$ and $m=2$. The analysis incorporates both the earlier proposed and the current updated LISA sensitivity curves, and I perform a comparative assessment with the TianQin mission in the relevant low-frequency band. To assess the robustness of the predicted signals, I estimate the gravitational responses using two different standard solar models based on the GS98 and AGSS09 abundance compilations. I find that the resulting signal responses are nearly identical for the two models, indicating that uncertainties in solar metallicity have a negligible impact on the detectability of solar $g$ modes by space-based interferometers.

Abstract: After a concise overview of Einstein spacetimes of type II (or more special) in four and five dimensions, we summarize recent results in the six-dimensional case. We assume the optical matrix to be non-degenerate and ``generic'', and the Weyl tensor to fall off sufficiently rapidly at infinity. As it turns out, the most general metric is characterized by one discrete (normalized) and three continuous parameters, is of type D and belongs to the Kerr-Schild class. Its relation to the previously known Kerr-(A)dS and Kerr-NUT-(A)dS metrics is clarified.

Abstract: This work investigates the geometrical properties of self-gravitating $N$-body systems from the perspective established by Henri Poincaré and Albert Einstein concerning the operational nature of measured geometry. Utilizing recent numerical analyses of central configurations--special equilibrium solutions to the Newtonian $N$-body problem--we uncover systematic spatial variations in nearest-neighbor particle separations correlated with the radial distance from the system's center of mass. We argue that these variations reflect a context-dependent, emergent effective geometry shaped by gravitational interactions, in accordance with Poincaré's assertion that measured geometry depends on the forces influencing measuring devices, and Einstein's view that rods and clocks define physical geometry through their local dynamics. By revisiting these foundational insights within a modern computational framework, we provide evidence that geometry in self-gravitating Newtonian systems is not a fixed background, but an emergent construct arising from internal physical interactions.

Abstract: We numerically investigate the dynamical evolution of spherically symmetric charge free wormholes. We concentrate on two specific examples, both of which exhibit wormhole expansion and wormhole collapse: the Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole, which is sourced by a real massless ghost scalar field, and the quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole in semiclassical gravity (which has a wormhole structure and is not a true black hole), which is sourced by a renormalized energy-momentum tensor. Despite their very different sources, we demonstrate that the dynamics of these two wormholes are remarkably similar. Our analysis focuses on diagrams for the areal radius and components of the energy-momentum tensor. This work also serves as a review, offering a detailed description of how to perform a spherically symmetric dynamical evolution using double null coordinates as well as a review of the static solutions for our two examples.

Abstract: In the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), the highly incomplete sampling of the technosignature search space is often considered as a plausible explanation for the persistent lack of detections over six decades of searches. If correct, this would imply that technosignatures may already have reached Earth without being detected or correctly identified. Here, we explore this possibility using a Bayesian inference framework to estimate present-day detectability given $n\ge 1$ undetected contacts over the past 65 years -- the period since the first SETI experiment. We show that achieving high detectability of technosignatures emitted within a few hundred light-years of Earth would require implausibly large $n$ values, even exceeding the population of habitable planets within that range. More conservative estimates can be obtained only assuming that emitters are tightly clustered near Earth or that their population in the Milky Way has undergone a very recent and sudden boost. This tension is further exacerbated for short-lived technosignatures and persists whether they are omnidirectional, as in Dysonian megastructures, or directional, as in intentional communication attempts. These findings suggest that, if undetected past contacts from the Milky Way have indeed occurred, the best prospects of detection may lie in searches extending over several thousand light-years, though only a few detectable technoemissions would be expected.

Abstract: We present a new approach to identify satellite trails (or other linear artifacts) in ACS/WFC imaging data using a modified Radon Transform. We demonstrate that this approach is sensitive to features with mean brightness significantly below the background noise level, and it is resistant to the influence of bright astronomical sources (e.g., stars, galaxies) in most cases. Comparing with a set of satellite trails identified by eye, we find a trail recovery rate of 85\% and a false detection rate (after removing diffraction spikes that are easily filtered) of 2.5\%. By performing an analysis using a much larger ACS/WFC data set where false trails are identified by their persistence across multiple images of the same field, we identify the Radon Transform parameter space and image properties where our algorithm is unreliable, and estimate a false detection rate of $\sim10\%$ elsewhere. We apply our method to ACS/WFC data taken between 2002 and 2022 to determine both the frequency of satellite trail contamination in science data and also the typical trail brightness as a function of time. We find the rate of satellite trail contamination has increased by approximately a factor of two in the last two decades, but there is no clear systematic evolution in the typical trail brightness. Our satellite trail identification program is available as part of the \texttt{acstools} package.

Abstract: Astronomical images often show sharp features that are caused by cosmic ray (CR) hits, hot pixels, or non-Gaussian noise. L.A.Cosmic (van Dokkum 2001) is a widely used edge detection algorithm that identifies and replaces such features. Here we describe dfcosmic, a direct python port of L.A.Cosmic utilizing PyTorch and C++ to enable efficient performance on both CPUs and GPUs. The code was developed for the MOTHRA array, which is projected to produce more than 1000 large format CMOS images every 15 minutes. Compared to previous python implementations, dfcosmic achieves a speed gain of at least 20%.

Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin observatory is expected to produce 10 million transient alerts per night in ugrizy filters, whilst Euclid is a visible to near-infrared space telescope engaged in a wide field survey. We present a prototype system to automatically match the transient alerts from Rubin to Euclid observations. The system produces joint light-curves containing both visible and near-infrared photometry, and joint image cutouts. Using Zwicky Transient Facility alerts as a proxy for Rubin, we demonstrate the system in use in cases where Euclid did and did not detect the transient and highlight the value that can be added in each case. For transients detected by Euclid these benefits include identifying the supernovae (SNe) in observations taken prior to ground-based detection, thereby better constraining the explosion time, such as SN 2024pvw detected ~3 d prior to ground based detections. In cases where Euclid did not detect the transient, we demonstrate the benefit of adding Euclid observations to improve host morphology measurements and associations.

Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission aims to detect gravitational waves by interferometrically measuring the change of separation between free-falling test masses (TMs). LISA's interferometers must deliver pm/rtHz sensitivity while accommodating beam tilts up to 1 mrad at the photodiodes, which degrade the interferometric amplitude and increase the induced readout noise coupling. This paper uses an analytical framework developed by the authors in a previous work, based on minimal and justified approximations, that relates beam tilt to the resulting heterodyne signal amplitude in a generic two-beam interferometer with circular-area photodiodes (PDs). A set of interferometric topologies is analyzed, all of high relevance for LISA. We derive the exact amplitude response for an infinite detector and a closed-form approximation for finite detectors, and we validate both against numerical simulations and experimental measurements on an ultra-stable LISA-representative testbed. We then use this model to quantify the phase-noise amplification arising from reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under tilt, showing that curvature mismatches between the interfering beams substantially enhance this effect. Finally, we introduce a compact function that captures the angular dependence of correlated and uncorrelated phase noises in quadrant photodiode (QPD)-based readouts. Here, a new noise feature, caused by wavefront curvature mismatch, is predicted and measured for the first time. These results indicate that controlling wavefront curvature mismatch in the test mass interferometer (TMI) is essential to limit excess phase noise. The models and results derived in this paper, although originating in the context of LISA, are general and can be applied to any interferometric topology undergoing tilts with pivot on the detector plane.

Abstract: Detecting the global 21 cm signal from the epoch of reionization remains a major observational challenge due to bright foregrounds and instrumental systematics. As part of the Colombian Antarctic Telescopes for 21 cm Absorption during Reionization (CANTAR) initiative, we present a simulation and analysis framework to evaluate antenna chromaticity, optimize instrument design, and assess site suitability for global 21 cm experiments. Using frequency-dependent beam models and Haslam-based sky maps, we compute dynamic spectra for the EDGES blade dipole and a set of dipole and novel monopole antennas optimized via particle swarm optimization. The optimized designs exhibit improved spectral smoothness compared to EDGES, particularly in the 70-120 MHz range. We also evaluate latitude-dependent sky brightness and identify mid-latitude sites (-40° to +5°) as optimal for foreground suppression. We apply Bayesian inference together with posterior predictive model validation to the publicly released EDGES data, assessing statistical consistency rather than hypothesis testing or model comparison. We find that physically motivated foreground and ionospheric models are statistically consistent with the data only when a 21 cm absorption feature is excluded. From the validated posterior, we generate a statistically validated ensemble of foreground corrections for use in beam-sky simulations. These results support a two-phase strategy for CANTAR: Antarctic deployments for calibration and testing, and future science operations at mid-latitude sites. Our framework provides a validated path toward robust foreground modeling, antenna design, and systematics control for global 21 cm signal detection.
