This results in entire optical/digital systems, which are traditionally designed sequentially, i.e. , the adaptive optics system is optimised first, and the restoration algorithms are designed a second time. Studies on optical/digital systems have shown that jointly optimizing the whole system is a better alternative. We propose to extend these co-design strategies to the design of an adaptive optics-assisted imaging system. We derive a simple criterion that takes into account the source properties and the entire optical/ digital system performance. To illustrate its interest, we use it to optimize the wavelength distribution between the wavefront sensor and the imaging camera. In addition, we explore the potential of using multiple imaging channels operating at different wavelengths as a means of making an imaging system robust to turbulence strength and source magnitude variations.

In our algorithm, we expand the wavefunction at the point of discontinuity, instead of the black hole horizon, and incorporate the Israel-Lanczos-Sen junction conditions. %As the wavefunction convergence condition becomes irrelevant, our proposed algorithm generalizes the original method by expanding the wavefunctions at the point of discontinuity, and the associated difficulty is mitigated by rectifying the recurrence relations between the expansion coefficients to incorporate the Israel-Lanczos-Sen junction conditions. We apply this algorithm to compute the QNMs of the modified Regge-Wheeler potential up to $2000$ modes with high precision. For the low-lying modes, the numerical results show excellent agreement with those obtained using the matrix and Prony methods. The high overtones are significantly deformed, owing to the presence of echoes due to the discontinuity. This deformation in the asymptotic QNM spectrum reveals universal features that are largely independent of the specific form of the discontinuity in the potential, seemingly coinciding with those observed in the modified P\u00f6schl-Teller effective potential.

By solving the modified Einstein field equations induced on the brane, we obtain explicit interior, shell, and exterior solutions without invoking the idealized thin-shell approximation. The gravastar core is modeled as a Bose--Einstein condensate, while the intermediate shell consists of ultra-dense stiff matter. Bulk Weyl corrections induce anisotropic effective pressures on the brane, a feature that emerges intrinsically in this scenario and supports stability. We analyze the active gravitational mass, energy, entropy, and proper thickness of the shell, and establish the junction conditions at the interfaces. Our analysis reveals that the SS gravastar exhibits suppressed or even negative effective mass, reflecting the repulsive nature of the interior condensate, and admits stable equilibrium solutions consistent with energy conditions. This highlights the SS braneworld gravastar as a physically viable compact object and a compelling alternative to black holes. A key novelty of our construction is that the stabilizing pressure anisotropy and suppressed effective gravitational mass arise dynamically from higher-dimensional Weyl corrections, rather than being imposed through ad hoc matter sources or thin-shell idealizations.

It exhibits two key anomalies: an insufficient rotational energy loss rate to power its observed X-ray luminosity, and a braking index of $ = 1.08\\pm 0.04$, which starkly contradicts the canonical magnetic dipole value of $n=3$. To explain these anomalies, we develop a unified spin-evolution model that self-consistently integrates magnetic dipole radiation, gravitational wave emission, and wind braking. Within this framework, we constrain the wind braking parameter to $\u03ba\\in [13, 37]$ from the nebular properties, finding it contributes substantially (17%-51%) to the current spin-down torque. Bayesian inference reveals that the birth period is poorly constrained by present data and is prior-dependent, indicating a millisecond birth is allowed but not required. Furthermore, we constrain the number of precession cycles to $\u03be\\sim 10^{4}$--$10^{5}$, and our analysis favors a toroidally-dominated internal magnetic field configuration as the most self-consistent explanation for the low braking index. Finally, we assess the continuous gravitational-wave detectability. The present-day signal is undetectable. However, the early-time signal might have reached the projected sensitivity of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories, such as the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (aLIGO) and the Einstein Telescope (ET), although a confident detection would require exceptionally stable rotation, an assumption considered highly optimistic for a young magnetar. This work establishes a unified framework that links magnetar spin-down with their interior physics and multi-messenger observables, providing a physically consistent interpretation for Swift J1834.9-0846 and a new tool for understanding similar extreme neutron stars.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

By analytically continuing black hole spacetimes to Euclidean signature, we define timelike correlations that reveal a sequence of timelike Page times at which the entanglement entropy equals the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Applying this framework to Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m, static higher-dimensional and braneworld solutions, four-dimensional Kerr, and higher-dimensional rotating Myers--Perry black holes, we demonstrate that timelike entanglement exhibits periodic or quasi-periodic behavior, with the recurrence times sensitive to surface gravity, charge, rotation, and spacetime dimensionality. Extremal and near-extremal black holes display effectively frozen thermal oscillations with persistent rotational modulation, reflecting their near-horizon geometries. Unlike conventional approaches based on islands or firewalls, our framework encodes information entirely in the Hawking radiation, preserving unitarity while avoiding violations of horizon smoothness. These results establish timelike entanglement as a robust and physically transparent mechanism for information recovery and provide a versatile tool for exploring quantum gravitational dynamics across a wide range of black hole spacetimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Here we consider systems composed of 1 GeV and 10 GeV dark matter. Relevant compact objects are then analysed and simulated as both static bodies, and rotating systems governed by the Hartle-Thorne formalism to second order.

This study proposes chaotic dynamics as a novel indicator for scalar hair in Horndeski gravity. We investigate the motion of a spinning test particle in a static, spherically symmetric hairy black hole spacetime. Our results show that increasing scalar hair systematically suppresses orbital chaos, as evidenced by regularized precession, reduced Lyapunov exponents, and contracted Poincare sections. Furthermore, scalar hair enhances the correlation between the two gravitational wave polarization modes, restoring phase coherence. These findings demonstrate that chaotic observables and gravitational wave signatures can jointly serve as sensitive probes for black hole hair, offering a complementary approach to testing gravity in strong-field regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A New Morphological Study of Tidal Disruption Event Host Galaxies", "comment": "20 pages, 9 figures", "summary": "Host galaxies of tidal disruption events (TDEs) show enhanced central stellar concentration and are preferentially found in post-starburst and green valley populations. This connection has led to the proposal that TDE host galaxies likely have gone through recent mergers. We conduct a new morphological study of 14 TDE host galaxies, using the r-band images from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), and Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), with the images from the latter two surveys having much higher depth and resolution than SDSS. We examine galaxy structures using conventional methods and also apply diagnostics of merger activity from machine learning models. Consistent with previous studies, our results show that TDE host galaxies are ~16% more centrally concentrated when compared to non-TDE-host controls. However, surprisingly, TDE hosts lack any indication of recent merger activity from both morphological analysis and our machine learning merger classifier. Instead, our results reveal that TDE host galaxies are approximately 1.5 to 2.5 times more likely to have bar-like or ring-like structures than their controls. This enhancement is even more prominent for TDEs in the green valley, with the factor reaching almost 3. Based on these results, we propose that bar-driven secular evolution, instead of merger, likely dominates the recent evolution of TDE hosts found in the green valley, which can simultaneously explain their distinctive nuclear properties and enhanced TDE rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the lack of updated measurements of its accretion disk, broad line region and dusty torus hampers a detailed interpretation of the role of accretion in the observed $\u03b3$-ray production. We intend to characterize, during high-activity states, the external photon fields contributing to the IR-to-UV emission$-$namely dusty torus, broad line region and accretion disk$-$and investigate potential variability and blurring effects on the broad emission lines. We present new spectroscopic observations of OP 313 with the NOT and TNG telescopes to characterize its optical spectrum and variability with respect to archival observations from SDSS. We measure the luminosity of different broad emission lines, characterizing the broad line region, accretion disk and dusty torus. We measure the Mg II emission line, with an average flux of $F_{\\mathrm{Mg \\ II}} = (0.85 \\pm 0.11)\\times 10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Its equivalent width and luminosity are consistent with a constant line with a variable non-thermal continuum.

These characteristics and the indicator of the accretion rate from the disk/Eddington luminosity ratio $\u03bb=L_{AD}/L_{Edd} = 0.23 \\pm 0.10$, along with a high Compton dominance, favour a FSRQ-like nature, contrary to the argued changing-look nature.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Comments welcome. Main arguments presented in Sections 1,2,5&6", "summary": "We revisit the spectral appearance of extended self-gravitating accretion disks around supermassive black holes. Using dust-poor opacity tables, we show that all optically thick disk solutions possess a universal outer effective temperature of $T_{\\rm eff}\\sim 4000-4500$K, closely resembling compact, high-redshift sources known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Assuming the extended disk is primarily heated by stellar sources, this ``disk Hayashi limit\" fixes the dominant optical continuum temperature of the disk spectrum independent of accretion rate $\\dot{M}$, black hole mass $M_\\bullet$, and disk viscosity $\u03b1$, and removes the parameter-tuning required in previous disk interpretations of LRDs. We construct global self-gravitating accretion disk models with radially varying accretion rates, suggesting that burning of embedded stellar objects can both efficiently power the emission of the outer disk and hollow out the inner disk, strongly suppressing variable UV/X-ray associated with a standard quasar. The resulting disk emission is dominated by a luminous optical continuum while a separate, non-variable UV component arises from stellar populations on the nuclear to galaxy scale. We map the optimal region of parameter space for such systems and show that LRD-like appearances are guaranteed for $\\dot{M}/\u03b1\\gtrsim 0.1 M_\\odot /{\\rm yr}$, a threshold insensitive to $M_\\bullet$, below which the system may transition into classical non-self-gravitating AGN disks, potentially a later evolution stage. We expect this transition to be accompanied by the enhancement of metallicity and production of dust, giving rise to far infrared emission. This picture offers a physically motivated and quantitative framework connecting LRDs with AGNs and their associated nuclear stellar population.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
