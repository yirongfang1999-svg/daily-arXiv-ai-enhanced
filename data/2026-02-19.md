Abstract: Long baseline optical and infrared interferometric arrays achieve high angular resolution and enable detailed astrophysical measurements. Interferometers have enabled observations of stars at various stages of evolution, as well as studies of binary stars, circumstellar disks, and active galactic nuclei. The CHARA Array is a long-baseline interferometric array at the Mount Wilson Observatory, USA. At the core of CHARA operations are the delay lines, which equalize the optical path length for all telescopes as the Earth rotates and compensate for optical path variations induced by atmospheric turbulence. We report recent upgrades and performance of the CHARA Array optical delay lines for high-precision interferometric observations. The legacy system had been operational for over two decades, and it was increasingly difficult to acquire replacement parts. Beginning in mid-2021, the control system underwent a major upgrade, replacing the aging VME-based architecture with a modern hybrid FPGA and Linux-based system; this modernization continued through the end of 2024. We describe hardware/software changes, the servo architecture, and lab/on-sky performance. The upgraded system achieves residual delay line cart tracking errors of $\sim12$~nm, the same level as the legacy system, and a control bandwidth of 100-130~Hz, allowing fringe tracking across the R, H, and K bands. Initial commissioning revealed key issues such as metrology time-tick jitter and vibration-induced visibility loss, which were diagnosed and resolved. We note ongoing and future efforts to extend baselines up to 1~km and support advanced observing modes such as dual-field interferometry and nulling. This paper is a reference for current and future use of the CHARA Array and for next-generation instrument design.

Abstract: Forbush decreases (FDs) are transient depressions in the galactic cosmic-ray flux observed by global neutron-monitor networks and are commonly associated with interplanetary disturbances driven by coronal mass ejections and related shocks. Despite extensive observational work, quantitatively comparing FD morphology across events and linking it to storm severity remains challenging due to heterogeneous station responses, coverage gaps, and the multivariate nature of the network. This work introduces a graph-based event representation in which each FD is mapped to an event network constructed from pairwise dissimilarities between station response time series. A controlled sparse backbone is obtained via the minimum spanning tree, enabling comparable event graphs across cases. From each graph, a compact set of geometric/topological fingerprints is computed, including global integration measures, spectral summaries, mesoscopic structure, centrality aggregates, and complexity descriptors.
  Predictive skill is assessed using strict leave-one-event-out validation over a pre-defined grid of distance metrics and distance-domain transformations, with selection criteria fixed \emph{a priori}. The proposed fingerprints exhibit measurable signal for three tasks: (i) multi-class classification of geomagnetic storm intensity (G3/G4/G5) with moderate but consistent performance and errors dominated by adjacent categories; (ii) stronger binary severity screening ($\ge$G4 vs.\ G3) with high sensitivity to severe events; and (iii) drop regression with partial least squares achieving positive explained variance relative to a fold-wise mean baseline.

Abstract: ATUS, the Astronomical Telescope of the University of Stuttgart, is a fully remote-controlled 0.6 m f/8.17 Ritchey-Chrétien telescope optimized for high-cadence, high-fidelity photometry of transient sources. Observations are time-referenced with very high accuracy and precision, making it an ideal platform for time-domain astronomy and space situational awareness. Initially conceived to support instrument developments and operations of SOFIA, the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, it evolved into a scientific instrument for various use cases in instrument development, astronomical research, and teaching. This paper presents an overview of its development and optimization to achieve diffraction-limited images and highly accurate pointing and tracking, even at high speeds. The findings and lessons learned are universally applicable to other telescopes that are currently at the planning stage, or where similar issues might be encountered.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, energetic, radio pulses of extragalactic origin. A dichotomy has emerged in the population: some produce repeat bursts, while the majority do not. Most repeating sources only show rare repetitions, and none have been studied extensively over the wide bandwidths necessary to disentangle the physical processes that produce emission from distortions to bursts caused by intervening ionised gas. Here we present radio observations of the most active repeating source, FRB 20240114A. Using an ultrawideband receiving system, we have detected 5526 repetitions, revealing an extreme spectral and temporal variability in the burst emission. The bursts exhibit longer-term broadband variations in central emission frequency over multiple months, and narrowband bursts that have correlations in central frequencies on time scales of milliseconds to minutes. The spectral and temporal properties are consistent with the source undergoing magnification by foreground plasma lenses, potentially embedded in a turbulent circumsource medium. This extreme example highlights the role of plasma lenses in the observed properties of burst emission and can explain the diversity in activity and energetics of the entire FRB population.

Abstract: Rapid localisation and follow-up of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) increasingly rely on low-latency triggers from new missions coupled to wide-field robotic optical facilities. We present the discovery and multi-wavelength follow-up of GRB 250818B, detected by the Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) and localised optically by the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO). We compile and homogenise X-ray, optical/NIR, and radio data to build broadband light curves and spectral energy distributions. The afterglow is unusually luminous for a nominal short GRB, lying on the bright end of the short-GRB population in X-rays and optical and among the most luminous high-redshift short-GRB afterglows in the radio. MeerKAT detects the source at 3.1 GHz, while ALMA provides deep higher-frequency limits. Keck/LRIS spectroscopy shows continuum and metal absorption (Fe II, Mg II, Mg I), giving $z=1.216$. Synchrotron forward-shock modelling favours a constant-density medium and strongly prefers refreshed (energy-injection) emission, well described by a two-component jet with $E_{K,iso} \sim 4\times10^{52}$ erg, $n_0 \sim 3.6$ cm$^{-3}$, $θ_j \simeq 0.10$ rad ($\sim 5.7$ deg), and $p \simeq 1.64$. The host association is ambiguous: the nearest LS DR10 galaxy candidate ($r_{AB} \sim 24.7$) is offset by $\sim 4$ arcsec ($\sim 34$ kpc) with chance-alignment probability $P_{cc} \sim 0.2$, and current imaging does not exclude a fainter, near-coincident host. SED fitting of the candidate host suggests a low-mass galaxy. GRB 250818B highlights the power of rapid wide-field counterpart identification in the SVOM era, while host-association uncertainty can still limit offset-based interpretation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Event horizons are a defining feature of black holes. Consequently, there have been many efforts to probe their existence in astrophysical black hole candidates, spanning ten orders of magnitude in mass. Nevertheless, horizons remain an obstacle to unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics, most sharply presented by the information paradox. This has motivated a proliferation of horizonless alternatives (black hole foils) that avoid event horizons and are therefore benign. We show that for typical accreting astronomical targets, largely independent of a foil's underlying microphysics, a horizonless compact surface will generically be ensconced within an optically thick, scattering dominated baryonic settling layer that efficiently reprocesses the kinetic energy of infalling matter into observable thermal emission. The emergent photosphere luminosity is driven toward the accretion-powered equilibrium value and is only weakly sensitive to the foil redshift. These atmospheres are convectively stable and naturally imply that the emitting photosphere forms at modest redshift even when the surface redshift is extreme. Moreover, local gas-surface interaction provides a microphysical lower bound on the effective base temperature, insulating the atmosphere from arbitrarily cold foils. The unknown properties of the foil enter only through local boundary conditions controlling baryon processing and thermal coupling at the surface, making the solutions broadly applicable to horizonless alternatives that do not invoke significant additional nonlocal interactions. Thus, under minimal assumptions (GR exterior and local surface interactions), horizonless foils are generically observationally exposed: the absence of a thermal photosphere directly constrains or rules out broad classes of such models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Power-law inflation with $a(t) \propto t^m$ is conceptually simple and predicts a scalar tilt $n_s = 1 - 2/m$ compatible with CMB data, but in four-dimensional Einstein gravity it typically yields a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r = 16/m$ that is too large to satisfy current bounds. We show that a minimal extension based on fractional scalar-field cosmology resolves this tension. Introducing a fractional order $α\neq 1$ generates non-local (memory) corrections in the Friedmann and Klein-Gordon dynamics that suppress $r$ while keeping $n_s$ essentially unchanged. We derive an explicit mapping $α(n,m)$ and recover the standard power-law limit as $α\to 1$. For observationally favored values $α\approx 0.8$-$0.9$ in four dimensions we obtain $n_s \approx 0.965$ and $r \lesssim 0.04$, bringing power-law inflation into agreement with data. The scalar potential follows self-consistently as an exponential, and a dynamical-systems analysis shows the fractional power-law solutions form stable inflationary attractors over the viable parameter range. These results establish fractional power-law inflation as a predictive and testable framework, with clear targets for forthcoming CMB polarization measurements.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The string-inspired running vacuum model (StRVM) of inflation is based on a Chern-Simons (CS) gravity effective action, in which the only four-spacetime-derivative-order term is a gravitational anomalous CS Pontryagin density coupled to an axion. In this work, we revisit curvature-squared string-inspired effective actions, from the point of view of appropriate local field redefinitions, leaving the perturbative string scattering matrices invariant. We require simultaneously unitarity and torsion interpretation of the field strength of the Kalb-Ramond antisymmetric tensor, features characterising the (3+1)-dimensional StRVM Cosmology. Unlike the higher dimensional case, the above feature is possible in the context of (3+1)-dimensional spacetimes, obtained after string compactification. We demonstrate that the unitarity and torsion-interpretation requirements lead to a single-type of extra four-derivative terms in the effective gravitational action, not discussed in the previous literature of StRVM, which however is shown to be subleading by many orders of magnitude, compared to the terms of the StRVM framework. Hence, its presence has no practical implications for the relevant inflationary (and, hence, postinflationary) physics of the StRVM. This demonstrates the phenomenological completeness of the StRVM cosmological scenario, which is thus fully embeddable in the UV complete (quantum-gravity compatible) string theory framework.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Spacetime singularities, in the sense that curvature invariants are infinite at some point or region, are thought to be impossible to observe, and must be hidden within an event horizon. This conjecture is called Cosmic Censorship (CC), and was formulated by Penrose. Here we review another type of CC where spacetime singularities are causally disconnected from the universe, because the throat of a wormhole ``sucks in'' the geodesics and prevents them from making contact with the singularity. In this work, we present a series of exact solutions to the Einstein--Maxwell--Dilaton equations that feature a ring singularity; that is, the curvature invariants are singular in this ring, but the ring is causally disconnected from the universe so that no geodesics can touch it. This extension of CC is called Wormhole Cosmic Censorship.

Abstract: Many attempts to introduce fundamental nonlocality into quantum (or classical) field theory are based on the assumption that exponentials of the d'Alembertian are positive-definite, so that these operators can be employed without engendering the Ostrogradskian instability associated with higher derivative Lagrangians. {\bf This assumption is false.} Working in the simple context of a 1-dimensional, point particle $q(t)$, I demonstrate that the equation $\exp[T^2 \tfrac{d^2}{dt^2}] q(t) = 0$ has an infinite number of rapidly oscillating, exponentially rising and falling solutions. This infinite kernel is in one-to-one correspondence with the ability to specify ``initial value data'' {\it arbitrarily} over {\it any} finite interval $t_1 < t < t_2$.

Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) image of M87* provides a direct test of strong-field gravity, measuring an angular shadow diameter $θ_d = 42 \pm 3~μ\mathrm{as}$ and a circularity deviation $ΔC \leq 0.1$. Such observations allow quantitative tests of the Kerr paradigm and of possible deviations from the no-hair theorem. In scalar-tensor extensions of gravity, black holes may possess primary scalar hair, introducing an additional independent parameter beyond mass and spin. In this work, we construct rotating black hole solutions with primary scalar hair in beyond Horndeski gravity and analyze their photon regions and shadow formation. We show that the scalar hair parameter $Q$ induces characteristic modifications of the shadow, and in particular negative $Q$ enlarges the shadow and reduces its oblateness, while positive $Q$ shrinks and enhances its distortion. Modeling M87* within this framework and imposing the EHT bounds on $θ_d$ and $ΔC$, we determine the viable $(a,Q)$ parameter space. We find that current observations do not exclude rotating black holes with primary scalar hair, although the allowed region is significantly restricted for $Q>0$. Finally, the scalar-hair-induced deviations are of order $\mathcal{O}(μ\mathrm{as})$, placing them near the sensitivity threshold of present instruments and within reach of next-generation horizon-scale imaging.

Abstract: We derive two model-independent results for spacetimes with globally bounded tidal fields. These are operational resolution scales of the local-inertial approximation and tidal dynamics; no spacetime discreteness is implied. Given an invariant bound $λ_{\max}\leλ_{\rm bound}$ on the electric Riemann eigenvalues $E_{ij}\equiv R_{\hat{0}i\hat{0}j}$ along freely falling worldlines, we prove (i)~a rigorous upper bound on accumulated geodesic deviation through any bounded curvature interior, controlled by $τ_*\equivλ_{\max}^{-1/2}$, and (ii)~the existence of a critical wavenumber $k_*\simτ_*^{-1}$ separating adiabatic from non-adiabatic perturbation transfer through high-curvature epochs, with Bogoliubov coefficients exponentially suppressed for $k\,τ_*\gg 1$. Both results depend only on the tidal bound (and, for mode transfer, on a mild timescale assumption for the curvature-driven effective potential) and are otherwise insensitive to metric details. For preparation, we collect the standard operational consequences of bounded curvature, including the accuracy-dependent local-inertial domain $L_{\rm LI}(\varepsilon)\sim\sqrt{\varepsilon}\, λ_{\max}^{-1/2}$ and, for conformally flat cores in four dimensions, the benchmark ratio $τ_*/L_*=24^{1/4}$ with $L_*\equiv K_{\max}^{-1/4}$. We quantify the robustness of this coefficient under departures from maximal symmetry via the Weyl-to-Kretschmann ratio $ε_C$. The general framework is validated numerically in the extremal Hayward geometry.

Abstract: A transient violation of the null energy condition (NEC) during inflation provides a novel mechanism for producing primordial black holes (PBHs) and stochastic gravitational wave (GW) backgrounds. In this work, we extend previous studies by computing the GW contributions from both the ringdown phase of PBH formation and subsequent binary mergers. Our results show that this scenario produces a rich, multi-component GW spectrum consisting of primordial GWs, scalar-induced GWs, and GW emissions from PBH ringdown and binary mergers. We demonstrate that these correlated signatures across different frequency bands provide a novel and powerful avenue to probe or constrain NEC violation during inflation through future multi-band GW observations.

Abstract: Deviations from the area law of the horizon entropy, in the cosmological setup, are known to lead to modified Friedmann equations governing the evolution of the universe. In this work, we propose that such modifications need not be introduced phenomenologically but can emerge dynamically from stochastic fluctuations of the spacetime metric. We consider a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe perturbed by a conformal, time-dependent noise factor, whose ensemble average vanishes, leaving the mean background geometry unchanged. By averaging the Einstein equations to second order in the fluctuation amplitude, we derive a modified Friedmann equation that includes an effective correction term. This correction is shown to be equivalent to the general expression obtained from an arbitrary deformation of the entropy-area relation. By specifying the statistical properties, particularly the variance of the conformal noise, we successfully reproduce the Friedmann equation corrections associated with several well-known generalized entropy frameworks, including Rényi, (dual) Kaniadakis, Barrow, logarithmic, and MOND inspired hypergeometric entropies. Our results suggest that deviations from the area law can be interpreted as the macroscopic, coarse-grained imprint of unresolved, microscopic stochastic degrees of freedom in spacetime.

Abstract: Black holes are the natural arena for exploring the interplay between gravity and thermodynamics. Although the association between black hole mechanics and black hole thermodynamics is well-established, the comprehensive geometric formulation of thermodynamic variables deserves further investigation. In this work, both Newman-Penrose (NP) and Geroch-Held-Penrose (GHP) formalisms are considered within the framework of horizon thermodynamics. We show that the NP formalism reformulates the horizon condition as the Penrose-Rindler equation. In this context, a Smarr-like formula for stationary black holes is recovered from the Penrose-Rindler equation reinterpreted as a horizon equilibrium of pressures, which includes a pressure associated with the horizon rotation. A complete geometric reformulation of this reinterpretation of the Penrose-Rindler equation evaluated at the horizon is developed within the GHP formalism. The GHP approach further inspires the introduction of the horizon-averaged matter pressure and its conjugate volume, thereby enabling a quasi-local realization of the Smarr-like formula for stationary black holes. This geometric formulation clarifies the connection between horizon dynamics and thermodynamics and offers a unified setting for extending black hole thermodynamics beyond spherical symmetry.

Abstract: We critically examine proposals for the so-called warp-drive spacetimes and classify these models based on their various restrictions within the framework of General Relativity. We then provide a summary of general formalism for each class, and in the process, we highlight some misconceptions, misunderstandings, and errors in the literature that have been used to support claims about the physicality and feasibility of these models. On the way, we prove several new no-go theorems. Our analysis shows that when the principles of General Relativity are applied correctly, most claims regarding physical warp drives must be reassessed, and it becomes highly challenging to justify or support the viability of such models, not merely due to the violation of energy conditions.

Abstract: X-ray reflection spectroscopy is a powerful tool for testing the Kerr hypothesis and probing the strong gravity regime around accreting black holes. Most tests of General Relativity (GR) assume that the spacetime around a black hole is circular, meaning the metric possesses a specific symmetry structure common to the Kerr solution. However, deviations from circularity are predicted by various modified gravity theories and non-vacuum General Relativity solutions. In this work, we test a specific non-circular metric constructed based on a locality principle, where the deviation from the Kerr spacetime is driven by the local spacetime curvature. To accurately model the reflection spectrum in this background, we implement a relativistic ray-tracing code in horizon-penetrating (ingoing Kerr) coordinates, which are favored for their ability to avoid introducing curvature singularities at the horizon in non-circular spacetimes. We apply this model to the high-quality \textit{NuSTAR} spectrum of the Galactic black hole binary EXO 1846--031. Our spectral analysis reveals a source with a high inclination angle ($ι\approx 76^{\circ}$) and a near-extremal spin parameter ($a_* \approx 0.98$). While we identify a global minimum in the parameter space suggesting a non-zero deformation ($\ell_{\mathrm{NP}} \approx 0.12$), the 99\% confidence interval fully encompasses the Kerr limit ($\ell_{\mathrm{NP}}=0$). We conclude that the current X-ray reflection data for EXO 1846--031 are consistent with the Kerr hypothesis. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using X-ray reflection spectroscopy to constrain non-circular metrics and establishes a framework for future tests.
