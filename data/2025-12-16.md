Abstract: We investigate optical variability across multiple timescales in a sample of radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert~1 (RL-NLSy1) galaxies, including $γ$-ray detected, $γ$-ray undetected, and non-jetted systems along with a comparison set of highly polarised core-dominated quasars (HPQs). Using Zwicky Transient Facility light curves, we measure fractional variability ($F_{\rm var}$) and rest-frame structure functions (SFs) to test whether short-term jet-linked variability is reflected in long-term behaviour. $γ$-ray detected RL-NLSy1s and HPQs show steeply rising SFs, revealing strong long-term coherence despite modest $F_{\rm var}$, consistent with Doppler-boosted synchrotron emission from relativistic jets. Non-jetted RL-NLSy1s exhibit the highest $F_{\rm var}$ but plateauing SFs, indicative of stochastic, disc-driven fluctuations lacking long-term coherence. $γ$-ray undetected RL-NLSy1s show the lowest $F_{\rm var}$ and nearly flat SFs, consistent with weak or absent jet activity across all timescales. Colour-magnitude trends show that jet-dominated sources exhibit redder-when-brighter behaviour, whereas disc-dominated systems exhibit bluer-when-brighter trends. These results show that SF-derived temporal coherence, rather than variability amplitude alone, is a promising diagnostic of jet dominance and orientation, offering a framework for interpreting AGN variability in forthcoming time-domain surveys.

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a $\sim$ millisecond-long transient phenomenon that propagate across extragalactic distances and are effectively a point source. Radio wave propagation through inhomogeneous distributions of plasma can act as a lens, generating multiple images of the emitted electric field. A lens can produce images of a point source where the phase of the electric field between images remains coherent when observed by a radio telescope. FRB 20220413B shows a complicated pulse structure with time separated components that may be image copies of the main components due to plasma lensing. We perform several analyses to determine if FRB 20220413B is consistent with expectations of a plasma lensed FRB. We analyze and fit the morphology of the burst to a plasma lens model and find consistency in the spectro-temporal profile but not the observed flux. Using the complex-valued channelized voltage data from the CHIME telescope, we perform a time-lag correlation analysis and report correlation signatures present in the electric field of FRB 20220413B. We find that there exists an excess correlation signature only in absolute power and not in phase. We perform a frequency-lag correlation analysis on the spectra of all subcomponents of the burst and find a consistent scintillation bandwidth across all components. We find the scintillation bandwidth is consistent with expectations of scattering due to the Milky Way. We interpret this as all burst components propagating through the same scintillation screen located in the Milky Way, which would generate the excess variance signature observed, even in the absence of phase coherence between burst components. We find that while the burst morphology can be modeled by a plasma lens, the coherent signature present in the time-lag correlation is consistent with the expectations of a common scattering screen, but not coherent plasma lensing.

Abstract: We analytically derive, and illustrate with a population synthesis model, the maximum offset of binary neutron star mergers ejected from their host galaxies. This approximate maximum offset is 300 kpc $\times\ (v_\mathrm{esc} / 500\ \mathrm{km}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1})^{-7}$, where $v_\mathrm{esc}$ is the escape velocity from the host galaxy. Massive hosts with high escape velocities are unlikely to yield very large offsets. This maximum offset should inform the host associations of mergers that are not coincident with galaxies. We also discuss potential correlations between offsets and system masses, and possibly the duration of the gamma-ray burst accompanying the merger.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Model-observation comparisons of type-I X-ray bursts (XRBs) can reveal the properties of accreting neutron star systems, including the neutron star compactness. XRBs are powered by nuclear burning and a handful of reactions have been shown to impact the model results. Reactions in the NiCu cycles, featuring a competition between $^{59}$Cu($p$,$γ$)$^{60}$Zn and $^{59}$Cu($p$,$α$)$^{56}$Ni, have been shown to be among the most important reactions as they are a critical checkpoint in $rp$-process flow and significantly impact the light curves and burst ashes. We report a direct measurement of $^{59}$Cu($p$,$α$)$^{56}$Ni bringing stringent constraints on this reaction rate. New results rule out a strong NiCu cycle in XRBs, with a negligible degree of recycling, $\leq$5\% up to 1.5 GK. The new reaction rate, when varied within new uncertainty limits, shows no impact on one-zone XRB model light-curves tailored for clocked-burster $\tt{GS 1826-24}$, hence removing an important nuclear physics uncertainty in the model-observation comparison.

Abstract: We construct a combined model to incorporate neutron star (NS) mass measurements with electromagnetic mass-radius constraints and gravitational-wave observations using Bayesian inference. We use different mass distributions for three populations depending on the companion stars: double neutron stars, NS - white dwarfs, and low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). To observe the effects of different parametrizations, we use two equation of state (EoS) models: a piecewise polytrope and a fixed sound-speed model at high densities in combination with a low-density EoS. Our results show that the mass distributions of these NS populations are distinct and sensitive to the EoS prior choices. In addition, using a uniform prior on the observable NS maximum mass rather than a nuisance parameter from the unknown high-density EoS, shifts the posterior maximum mass to larger values. For polytrope-like EoSs, the maximum mass posterior shifts from $M_\mathrm{max}=2.09_{-0.07}^{+0.18} M_\odot$ to $2.15_{-0.10}^{+0.19} M_\odot$ at the 90% confidence level. This change in prior also impacts the posterior for the shape of the mass distribution of NSs in LMXBs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Very recently, a significant $\sim 20$ GeV gamma-ray excess in the Milky Way halo has been reported and a dark matter origin has been suggested. The inferred dark matter parameters are $ m_χ\sim 0.5-0.8 $ TeV and $ \langle σv \rangle \sim (5-8) \times 10^{-25}~{\rm cm^3~s^{-1}}$ for the $ b\bar{b} $ channel. If correct, prominent antiproton emission is produced and can be directly tested by the AMS-02 data. In this work we calculate the corresponding antiproton emission and show that the expected flux at $\sim 100$ GeV is already above the AMS-02 observation. A proper treatment on the antiproton background resulting from the high energy cosmic ray propagation would suggest an annihilation cross section of $< 2\times 10^{-26}~{\rm cm^3~s^{-1}}$, which is a few$\times 10$ times lower than that needed to interpret the potential signal. We therefore conclude that the $\sim 20$ GeV gamma-ray excess in the Milky Way halo is not a viable dark matter signal.

Abstract: The merger rate of primordial black hole (PBH) binaries can be used to understand the source population of the merging black hole binaries observable through gravitational-waves (GWs) and also to constrain the possible contribution of PBHs to dark matter. In the literature, the PBH merger rate is calculated analytically, assuming that PBH binaries stay in isolation (i.e. are unperturbed) and evolve solely via GW emission during their entire lifetime. However, if some or all of dark matter consists of PBHs, then as cosmic structures grow, PBH binaries and single PBHs fall inside dark matter halos. In those halos, the PBH binaries' interactions with their environment significantly affect the subsequent evolution of their orbital properties. In this paper, we present a numerical framework that accurately calculates the total PBH merger rate by combining the evolution of isolated binaries outside halos with the dynamics of binaries inside halos. In our work we have found that the isolated binary channel is suppressed at low redshifts and dynamical interactions in halos reshape the merger rate evolution with time, accelerating some mergers. At redshifts of $\lesssim 2$ the total merger rate is a factor of $\simeq 50 \%$ higher than the results assuming that all PBH binaries effectively stay unperturbed until their merger. Our simulations provide a definitive calculation on the total PBH merger rates, that are currently being probed and constrained from gravitational-wave observations. We make our merger rates publicly available at Zenodo

Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive catalog of short bursts from magnetars based on eight years of NICER observations. A total of 1130 bursts were identified, making this the largest magnetar burst catalog to date. The sample is dominated by SGR 1935+2154, which contributes 76% of all detected bursts. We analyzed burst durations, spectral properties, and their correlations across multiple sources. Bursts from SGR 1935+2154 exhibit significantly longer durations, with a mean of 317 ms, compared to a mean of 23 ms for bursts from other magnetars. Two microsecond-scale bursts were detected for the first time, originating from 1E 1048.1-5937 and CXOU J010043.1-721134. Spectral analysis in the 0.5--8 keV range using both blackbody and power-law models shows that bursts with higher fluences have harder spectra. In contrast, correlations between burst duration and spectral parameters are weak or absent. This catalog provides a valuable dataset for studying magnetar short bursts, enabling future modeling efforts and improving our understanding of the diversity and physical mechanisms of magnetar bursts.

Abstract: This paper investigates how a self bound equation of state (EOS), which describes strange quark stars, affects the rotational properties of compact stars, focusing on deviations from universal relations governing gravitational mass and radius changes due to rotation. The analysis reveals significant deviations in stars with higher surface-to-center total energy-density ratios, $\frac{ε_s}{ε_c+c^2P_c}$, challenging the established universal relations.
  For Newtonian stars, hydrostatic equilibrium ensures that the difference between the gravitational potential at the center, $Φ_c$, and at the poles, $Φ_p$, remains constant within sequences of rotating neutron stars characterized by the same central and polar specific enthalpy ($Φ_c - Φ_p = -h_c +h_p$). Combined with the scaling $Φ\propto R_e^2$, where $R_e$ denotes the equatorial radius, this condition naturally leads to a quasi-universal behavior in the rotational change of radius within these sequences. Similarly, in general relativistic stars, the hydrostatic equilibrium maintains that $Φ^{GR}_{p} - Φ^{GR}_{c}$ remains unchanged within these sequences, where $Φ^{GR}$ is one of the metric potentials.
  Inspired by this theoretical framework, a toy model has been developed to capture the dependence of gravitational mass and radius deviations on the surface-to-central total energy density ratio. Subsequently, an improved set of empirical universal relations has been proposed, for accurately modeling rapidly rotating compact stars with self-bound EOSs.

Abstract: We select seventy tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates among X-ray transients discovered during the eROSITA all-sky surveys in the Eastern Galactic hemisphere between December 2020 and February 2022 (eRASS1--5). We cross-match each X-ray source to a host galaxy in archival optical surveys using Bayesian likelihood-ratio techniques and obtain Keck/LRIS spectroscopy for all 70 host galaxies. Host properties are inferred through SED fitting with Prospector and emission line analysis with pPXF. We develop a robust classification scheme using X-ray and broad line luminosities, narrow-line ionization diagnostics, and optical variability to identify high-confidence TDEs, for which we analyze optical spectral features, light curve properties, and host galaxy demographics. Our final sample contains 52 TDEs with redshifts of $0.018 \leq z\leq0.714$, comprising 41 gold (high-confidence) and 11 silver (lower-confidence) events. The vast majority (93\%) of gold TDEs are intrinsically brighter in the X-ray band, with $L_{\rm X,peak} > L_{\rm opt,peak}$. Among 23 events with detected optical flares, delayed X-ray peak is commonly observed. We identify transient spectral features in eight events, including six with prominent broad \ion{He}{II} $λ$4686 and/or H$α$ emission and two coronal-line TDEs. Host galaxy demographics reveal modest over-representation in green valley ($\times1.8$) and quiescent Balmer-strong ($\times5.3$) galaxies, significantly weaker than previous TDE samples, demonstrating greater diversity in star formation histories than previously recognized. Most TDE hosts exhibit suppressed star formation relative to the main sequence, consistent with X-ray selection biases against dusty star-forming galaxies.

Abstract: The indirect ground-based observations of cosmic rays through extensive air showers in modern experiments typically involve the use of Monte Carlo simulations to determine the characteristics of the primary particles. These simulations necessitate assumptions about particle interactions at energies that have not yet been experimentally probed, which introduces systematic uncertainties in key observables, particularly the number of muons. Current research on this uncertainty primarily focuses on hadronic interaction models, the dominant source of muon production. This study presents an approach that takes into account another significant mechanism for muon generation: photonuclear reactions. A robust heuristic technique has been developed to estimate the contribution of these interactions to the total number of muons over a wide range of extensive air shower parameters (including primary particle type, energy, and slant atmospheric depth) and photonuclear interaction models, with an absolute percentage error on the order of $10\%$ in the estimated number of muons. Furthermore, several potential applications of the suggested method in relation to modern challenges in extensive air shower physics are discussed.

Abstract: Theoretical studies of transonic accretion onto black holes reveal a wide range of possible solutions, broadly classified into smooth flows and flows featuring shocks. Accretion solutions that involve the formation of shocks are particularly intriguing, as they are expected to naturally produce observable variability features. However, despite their theoretical significance, time-dependent studies exploring the stability and evolution of such shocked solutions remain relatively scarce. To address this gap, we perform simulations of transonic accretion flows around a black hole in ideal magneto-hydrodynamic framework. Our simulations are initialized using boundary conditions derived from semi-analytical hydrodynamical models, allowing us to explore the stability of these flows under varying magnetic field strengths. The presence of magnetic fields modifies the dynamics of the accretion flow through magnetic pressure, and the resulting force imbalance induces oscillations in the position of shock front. Our results show that variations in the emitted luminosity arising from shock oscillations appear as quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), a characteristic feature commonly observed in accreting black holes. We find that the QPO frequency is determined by the radial position of the shock front: oscillations occurring closer to the black hole produce frequencies of tens of hertz, whereas shocks located farther out yield sub-hertz frequencies

Abstract: This paper primarily explores the dynamics of charged particle in the magnetized SV spacetime, and constrains the parameters of the SV spacetime along with its surrounding magnetic fields. The constraints are given by using $χ^2$ analysis combined with high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (HFQPO) data observed from three microquasars: GRS 1915+105, XTE 1550-564, and GRO J1655-40. The results indicate that the magnetic field significantly influences the position of the innermost stable circular orbit of charged particle and frequency distribution of epicyclic motion, which excites more resonance model variants, enhancing observational effects. Additionally, we employ the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to evaluate resonance model and its various variants. The support for different models from observational data shows significant variation: $E R_8$ as the best model is supported strongly, $ER_3$ model has moderate evidence of support, $ER_6$ and $ER_7$ models are considerably less support, while other resonance models have essentially no support. For models more supported by the observational data, the allowed ranges of the regularization parameter: $0\leq a<0.736$ ($68\%$ confidence level) suggests that HFQPOs data support the magnetized black bounce spacetime as a regular black hole, and the smaller value of the regularization parameter indicates a possibility of the presence of quantum effects. According to the constraint results, we get the best-fit values of magnetic field strength around $10^{-5}\sim 10^{-4}$ GS for electrons and around $10^{-2}\sim 10^{-1}$ GS for protons. Finally, as a comparison, we test the SV spacetime without a magnetic field using microquasar observational data, and the calculated results of AIC show that this case is incompatible with the HFQPOs data, further supporting the existence of a magnetic field in SV spacetime.

Abstract: We present a search for soft $γ$-ray emission from the merging galaxy cluster SPT-CL J2012-5649 (Abell~3667) using archival INTEGRAL/ISGRI observations. This cluster located at $z=0.0556$ hosts prominent radio relics associated with merger-driven shocks, suggesting the presence of relativistic electrons capable of producing inverse-Compton (IC) emission in the 30--300~keV band. Using standard OSA~11.2 imaging and spectral pipelines and a total effective exposure of 2506~s, we find no significant emission at the cluster position in any energy interval. The extracted ISGRI spectrum is consistent with pure background, and no physically meaningful model parameters can be constrained. From the mosaic variance maps, we derive a conservative $3σ$ upper limit of $F_{30-300\,\mathrm{keV}} < 6.9 \times 10^{-9}\,\mathrm{erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$ assuming a power-law spectrum with $Γ= 2$. This limit rules out bright IC scenarios and constrains the efficiency of merger-driven particle acceleration in SPT-CL J2012-5649. Our results provide the most stringent soft $γ$-ray constraint on this system to date and highlight the need for next-generation hard X-ray missions, such as HEX-P or eXTP, to probe IC emission at theoretically predicted levels in merging clusters.

Abstract: Based on archival Chandra observations, we present a systematic timing survey of several hundred X-ray sources in M31, M81, and Centaurus A, mostly low-mass X-ray binaries (LXMBs), focusing on searching and characterizing aperiodic and periodic variability within single observation. We identify flares in 24 sources in M31, 5 in M81, and 26 in Cen~A; several display recurrent events. Flare durations span from tens of seconds to a few $10^{4}$ s, with peak luminosities of $10^{37}$-$10^{40}\ \mathrm{erg\ s^{-1}}$ and low flare duty cycles of $4.9\times10^{-6}$-$3.5\times10^{-2}$. Dipping events are found in 8 sources in M31, 1 in M81, and 5 in Cen A, including two repeaters. On multi-epoch baselines, the standard deviation of the source luminosity correlates linearly with the mean luminosity, with a coefficient of 0.49 (M31), 0.30 (M81), and 0.67 (Cen A), indicating galaxy-to-galaxy diversity. No statistically significant periodic signals are detected in M81 or Cen A, which, along with several periodic signals previously found among the M31 sources, can be understood considering a joint effect of our detection sensitivity and intrinsic distributions of the orbital period and X-ray luminosity of LMXBs. The ensemble of short-duty-cycle flares, a mix of recurrent and isolated dips, and galaxy-dependent rms--flux factor, supports a picture in which stochastic accretion-rate fluctuations modulate luminosity on $\sim$10-$10^{4}$ s. Conducted at known distances and across distinct host environments, this extragalactic survey provides uniform flare/dip samples and rms-flux scalings for bulge-dominated fields, offering empirical constraints for accretion physics and illustrating the promise of timing analyses in external galaxies using the Chandra archive.

Abstract: Shear flows, ubiquitous in space and astrophysical plasmas, can accelerate particles through turbulence excited by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We present the first numerical study of particle acceleration in non-relativistic, magnetized, and purely shear-driven turbulence that includes full particle backreaction. Using two-dimensional MHD-PIC simulations with an initially uniform flow-aligned magnetic field and external stirring force, we demonstrate that sustained particle acceleration requires continuously driven turbulence, whereas freely decaying turbulence rapidly depletes its energy reservoirs and halts the acceleration. The acceleration mechanism operates through the systematic distortion of gyro-orbits by turbulent electric fields: acceleration phases extend the particle trajectory along the electric force, increasing the energy gain, while deceleration phases shorten the trajectory, reducing the energy loss. This asymmetry produces net energy gain despite stochastic fluctuations, with the mean energy change scaling quadratically with shear velocity, characteristic of second-order Fermi acceleration. Initially monoenergetic particles develop substantial non-thermal tails after the turbulence onset. For particles repeatedly crossing shear layers, their energization follows geometric Brownian motion with weak systematic drift, yielding a log-normal distribution. High-energy particles exhibit pitch-angle anisotropy, becoming preferentially perpendicular to the flow-aligned magnetic field as their gyroradii exceed the turbulent layer width. These results establish shear-driven turbulence as a viable particle acceleration mechanism, providing a general model for particle energization in shear flows.

Abstract: We present a new non-relativistic reflection model, DAO, designed to calculate reflection spectra in the rest frame of accretion disks in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei. The model couples the XSTAR code, which treats atomic processes, with the Feautrier method for solving the radiative transfer equation. A key feature of DAO is the incorporation of a high-temperature corrected cross section and an exact redistribution function to accurately treat Compton scattering. Furthermore, the model accommodates arbitrary illuminating spectra, enabling applications across diverse physical conditions. We investigate the spectral dependence on key physical parameters and benchmark the results against the widely used reflionx and xillver codes.

Abstract: We report the discovery of 12 new radio pulsars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) as part of the TRAPUM (TRAnsients and PUlsars with MeerKAT) Large Survey Project, using the MeerKAT L-band receivers (856--1712\,MHz). These pulsars, discovered in 18 new pointings with 2\,hour integration times, bring the total number of pulsars identified by this ongoing survey to 19 (yielding a total of 44 LMC radio pulsars now known), representing an 80 per cent increase in the LMC radio pulsar population to date. These include PSR\,J0454$-$6927, the slowest extragalactic radio pulsar discovered to date, with a spin period of 2238\,ms, and PSR\,J0452$-$6921, which exhibits the highest dispersion measure (DM) among extragalactic radio pulsars, at 326\,pc\,cm$^{-3}$. The fastest spin period among the new discoveries is 245\,ms, and the lowest DM is 62\,pc\,cm$^{-3}$. We also present timing results for our first pulsar discoveries with MeerKAT and the Murriyang radio telescope, obtaining phase-connected solutions for seven pulsars in the LMC. These results indicate that the pulsars are isolated, canonical radio pulsars with characteristic ages up to 8.8\,Myr

Abstract: We report on the average and orbital phase-resolved polarization of Cyg X-3 in the hard state during the 2023 Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observational campaign. We find the polarization degree of $ 21.2 \pm 0.4 \% $ and polarization angle of $ 92.2 \pm 0.5^\circ $, well compatible with the first hard-state IXPE observation in 2022. As the observed polarization depends on both the accretion geometry and the X-ray emission mechanism, which we attribute to reflection from the optically thick envelope surrounding the central source, our result indicates that both are very stable on year-long timescale. We discuss time- and energy-dependent polarization properties and their implications for the geometry and stability of the accretion funnel.

Abstract: The early time emission in tidal disruption events (TDEs) originates from both accretion and shocks, which produce photons that eventually emerge from an inhomogeneous photosphere. In this work, we model the disk formation following the debris stream self-intersection in a TDE. We track the multi-band emission using three-dimensional, frequency-integrated and multi-group radiation hydrodynamic simulations. We find a more circularized disk forms about 24 days following the initial stream-stream collision, after the mass fallback rate peaks and once the debris stream density decreases. Despite the absence of a circularized disk at early times, various shocks and the asymmetric photosphere are sufficient to drive a wide range of optical-to-X-ray ratios and soft-X-ray variability. We find that with strong apsidal precession, the first light is from the stream-stream collision. It launches an optically-thick outflow, but only produces modest prompt emission. The subsequent optical and ultraviolet (UV) light curve rise is mainly powered by shocks in the turbulent accretion flow close to the black hole. The optical-UV luminosity peaks roughly when the disk forms and shock-driven outflows subside. The disk is optically and geometrically thick, extending well beyond the circularization radius. Radiation pressure clears the polar region and leaves optically-thin channels. We obtain the broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) directly from multi-group simulations with 16-20 frequency groups. The SED has a black body component that peaks in the extreme UV. The soft X-ray component either resembles a thermal tail, or can be described by a shallower power law associated with bulk Compton scattering. The blackbody parameters are broadly consistent with observed optical TDEs and vary weakly with viewing angle. In contrast, soft X-ray emission is highly angle-dependent.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: MAXI J1957+032 is an accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar that shows brief, recurrent outbursts in an ultra-compact ~1 h orbit. We characterise the 2025 outburst using X-ray timing and spectroscopy from XMM-Newton and Swift (and a late-time NuSTAR observation), together with contemporaneous optical photometry from LCO, and compare the spin frequency with the 2022 outburst. Timing searches detect coherent pulsations at ~313.6 Hz with no measurable frequency derivative during the XMM-Newton exposure. Relative to its 2022 outburst, we measure a long-term spin-down of ~-2x10^-14 Hz s^-1, consistent with magnetic-dipole braking in quiescence. The pulse profile is nearly sinusoidal, with significant power at the fundamental, second, and fifth harmonics; the fractional amplitude decreases with increasing flux and shows soft lags up to a few keV. The 0.5-10 keV spectrum is well described by absorbed thermal Comptonisation (photon index ~2.4) plus a cool blackbody (kT ~0.23 keV) consistent with emission from a surface hotspot; no reflection or Fe-line features are detected. Requiring R_m \leq R_co implies B_s ~(0.5-3)x10^8 G for d=(5 \pm 2) kpc and ξ=0.3-0.5, below the upper limit from the secular spin-down (B_p \leq 10^9 G), possibly indicating a mildly leaky propeller. The optical emission lies on the neutron-star branch of the L_OIR-L_X relation, consistent with reprocessing in a compact disc. The optical SEDs are broadly flat, while an early red excess suggests a transient jet contribution during the initial hard X-ray phase; an optical peak delayed relative to the X-rays may trace an outward-propagating heating front and rapid disc evolution in these short-lived outbursts.

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, millisecond-duration radio bursts with poorly known origins. Most FRB sources are detected only once, while some are repeaters. Variation patterns observed in the rotation measure (RM) of some repeaters -- indicate that the local magneto-ionic environments of these FRB sources are highly dynamic. It has been suggested that a Be star-magnetar binary system is a possible origin for such variation. FRB 20201124A is notable among these sources since it is the most active one and exhibits substantial temporal variations of RM measured by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The physics behind this long-term behavior is poorly understood. Here we propose that, within the framework of the Be star-magnetar binary scenario, the observed variation of RM is attributed to a combination of orbital motion and the precession of the circumstellar disk of the Be star. While a ~785-day precession of the disk contributes to the observed decrease in the amplitude of the variation, our model predicts that the amplitude oscillates with this period.

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most luminous explosions in the Universe and serve as powerful probes of the early cosmos. However, the rapid fading of their afterglows and the scarcity of spectroscopic measurements make photometric classification crucial for timely high-redshift identification. We present an ensemble machine learning framework for redshift classification of GRBs based solely on their optical plateau and prompt emission properties. Our dataset comprises 171 long GRBs observed by the Swift UVOT and more than 450 ground-based telescopes. The analysis pipeline integrates robust statistical techniques, including M-estimator outlier rejection, multivariate imputation using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations, and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator feature selection, followed by a SuperLearner ensemble combining parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric algorithms. The optimal model, trained on raw optical data with outlier removal at a redshift threshold of z equals 2.0, achieves a true positive rate of 74 percent and an area under the curve of 0.84, maintaining balanced generalization between training and test sets. At higher thresholds, such as z equals 3.0, the classifier sustains strong discriminative power with an area under the curve of 0.88. Validation on an independent GRB sample yields 97 percent overall accuracy, perfect specificity, and an ensemble area under the curve of 0.93. Compared to previous prompt- and X-ray-based classifiers, our optical framework offers enhanced sensitivity to high-redshift events, improved robustness against data incompleteness, and greater applicability to ground-based follow-up. We also publicly release a web application that enables real-time redshift classification, facilitating rapid identification of candidate high-redshift GRBs for cosmological studies.

Abstract: Based on broadband timing analysis of Insight-HXMT and NICER data from the 2019 outburst of the black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) MAXI J1348-630, we report the detection of the coexistence and competitive interplay between type-C and type-B quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). Specifically, the two QPO types were detected simultaneously but exhibited distinct energy dependencies: the type-C QPO was dominant in the hard X-ray band (10-30 keV), while the type-B QPO was more prominent in the soft X-ray band (1-10 keV). Further analysis reveals that the emergence of the type-C QPO suppresses the strength of the type-B QPO, particularly above 10 keV. Tracking the detailed evolution of these QPOs, we find that the weakening of the type-B QPO coincides with the strengthening of the type-C QPO, indicating a competitive interaction between them. These findings reveal a more complex relationship between type-B and type-C QPOs than previously recognized, suggesting they originate from distinct but interacting physical components within the accretion flow and/or jet, and providing new insights into the dynamics of accretion state transitions.

Abstract: A complete understanding of the cosmic-ray energy spectrum remains a challenge to theory that must be met by comprehensive modeling efforts. One of these is the subject of the present study, namely, an explanation of the recently discovered spectral hardening at $\sim 300$ GeV with self-consistently treated cosmic-ray diffusion, where self-generated waves resulting from the streaming instability impact the diffusion of high-energy particles. We revisit the corresponding model by Blasi et al. (2012), perform an extensive parameter study, and determine an optimal range of parameters that best fit the cosmic-ray data. We conclude that self-consistently treated cosmic-ray transport remains a competitive alternative to explain the spectral hardening of the cosmic-ray energy spectrum at a few hundred GeV.

Abstract: Stellar-mass binary black holes (sBBHs) formed in globular clusters (GCs) are promising sources for multiband gravitational wave (GW) observations, particularly with low- and middle-frequency detectors. These sBBHs can retain detectable eccentricities when they enter the sensitivity bands of low-frequency GW observatories. We study multiband GW observations of eccentric sBBHs that escape from GC models simulated with the MOCCA code, focusing on how low- and middle-frequency detectors can constrain their eccentricities and other parameters. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we generate ten realizations of cosmic sBBHs by combining the MOCCA sample with a cosmological model for GC formation and evolution. We then assess their detectability and the precision of parameter estimation. Our results show that LISA, Taiji, the LISA-Taiji network (LT), and AMIGO could detect $0.8\pm0.7$, $11.6\pm2.0$, $15.4\pm2.7$, and $7.9\pm1.3$ escaping sBBHs, respectively, over four years, while LT-AMIGO could detect $20.6\pm3.0$ multiband sBBHs in the same period. LT and AMIGO can measure initial eccentricities with relative errors of approximately $10^{-6}-2\times10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}-0.7$, respectively. Joint LT-AMIGO observations have a similar ability to estimate eccentricities as LT alone.

Abstract: We present the first X-ray polarimetric measurement of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary system AX J1745.6-2901 conducted by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) satellite. This transient source, located within $ \sim $1.5' of the Galactic center, was observed serendipitously during a MAXI J1744-294 observation with a duration of 150 ks. The complex nature of the region in which AX J1745.6-2901 is located poses a challenge for studying its polarization. By performing a detailed analysis of the contamination from MAXI J1744-294 and the Galactic center diffuse emission, we find the source polarization degree PD = 14.7$\% \pm$ 4.0$\%$ and polarization angle PA = 122$^\circ \pm 8^\circ$. The phase-resolved analysis shows increase in polarization during the eclipse phase, with PD = 34.2$\% \pm$ 8.7$\%$, suggesting that the polarization-inducing mechanisms are of scattering nature, probably originating from disk winds.

Abstract: A recent analysis of pulsar timing data has reported evidence for a massive ($\sim 6 \times 10^7 M_{\odot}$) dark matter subhalo located only $\sim 0.8$ kpc from Earth. This candidate implies an exceptionally large $J$-factor of $\sim 10^{23}\,{\rm GeV^2\,cm^{-5}}$, exceeding that of known classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies by orders of magnitude and rivaling the Galactic Center. In this work, we utilize more than 17 years of $\textit{Fermi}$-LAT data to search for gamma-ray emission from this subhalo. We identify a tentative excess in the region with ambiguous origin. Adopting a conservative strategy, we retain this excess without modeling additional astrophysical components, treating it instead as unmodeled background to derive upper limits on the dark matter annihilation cross-section for the $b\bar{b}$ and $τ^+τ^-$ channels. Despite this conservative treatment, the resulting limits remain stringent due to the exceptionally large $J$-factor. Subject to the dynamical confirmation of the subhalo, these constraints are potentially orders of magnitude stronger than those obtained from combined analyses of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and blind subhalo searches.

Abstract: Magnetic field evolution in neutron star cores is not fully understood. We describe the field evolution both for one barotropic fluid as well as two collisionally coupled barotropic fluids with different density profiles using the anelastic approximation and the Navier-Stokes equations to simulate the evolution in three dimensions. In the one-fluid case, a single fluid describes the motion of the charged particles. In the two-fluid model, the neutral fluid is coupled to the electrically conductive fluid by collisions, the latter being dragged by the magnetic field. In this model, both fluids have distinct density profiles. This forces them to move at slightly different velocities, resulting in a relative motion between the two barotropic fluids -- ambipolar diffusion. We develop a code based on Dedalus and study the evolution of simple poloidal dipolar and toroidal magnetic fields. Previous 2D studies found that poloidal magnetic fields evolve towards a stable Grad-Shafranov equilibrium. In our 3D simulations we find an instability of the two-fluid system similar to the one in the barotropic fluid system. After the instability saturates, a highly non-linear Lorentz force introduces small-scale fluid motion that leads to turbulence, development of a cascade and significant, non-axially symmetric changes in the magnetic field configuration. Fluid viscosity plays an essential role in regularizing the small-scale fluid motion, providing an energy drain.

Abstract: Pulsar glitches are unresolved increments of the rotation rate that sometimes trigger an enhancement of the spin-down rate. On occasions, the augmented spin-down decays gradually in an exponential manner, particularly after the largest glitch events. The young pulsar PSR J0537-6910 exhibits the highest known glitching rate, with 60 events detected in nearly 18 years of monitoring. Despite most PSR J0537-6910 glitches being large, only one exponential recovery has been reported, following its first discovered glitch. This is puzzling, as pulsars of similar characteristics typically present significant exponential recoveries. We aim to determine whether this reflects an intrinsic difference in PSR J0537-6910 or a detectability issue, for example due to its high glitch frequency. The full dataset, including recent NICER observations, was systematically searched for exponential relaxations. Each glitch was tested for evidence of a recovery over a broad range of trial timescales. Promising candidates were investigated further by comparing recovery models with and without an exponential term using Bayesian evidence. We discovered six new glitches, bringing the total to 66. Our criteria strongly indicates the presence of 11 previously undetected exponential recoveries. We presente updated glitch and timing solutions. Exponential recoveries are detected only for the largest glitches, though not all of them. The inferred timescales range from 4 to 37 d, with the decaying frequency increment generally below $1\%$ of the total. We find that $\ddotν$ can remain stable across several glitches, with persistent changes associated with only some events. In particular, it tends to be lowest after glitches with exponential recoveries, yielding inter-glitch braking indices between 6 and 9. Following glitches without recoveries, $\ddotν$ is higher, leading to braking indices between 10 and 35.

Abstract: We present the timing solutions for three radio pulsars discovered with the Green Bank North Celestial Cap (GBNCC) and 350-MHz Green Bank Telescope drift-scan surveys. These pulsars were initially discovered through their single-pulse emission and therefore designated as rotating radio transients (RRATs). Follow-up timing campaigns yielded a number of higher signal-to-noise summed pulse profiles for each pulsar, allowing us to obtain timing solutions both through single pulses as well as the standard method of time-integrating the pulsar's emission. We find that the two methods return timing parameters which are usually in agreement within two standard deviations, and have similar sized error bars. The single-pulse timing solutions have significantly higher RMS errors and reduced chi-squared values, likely due to pulse jitter. The distribution of wait times between detected single pulses indicates a significant amount of pulse clustering in time on short timescales from all three sources. For all sources, the presence of low-level emission outside of the sparse bright pulses and lack of giant pulses is more reminiscent of highly nulling canonical radio pulsars than extremely transient RRATs, highlighting the diversity of emission behavior observed from sources published as RRATs.

Abstract: In the innermost regions of active galactic nuclei, where the accretion disk, corona, and jet processes are closely coupled, X-ray observations offer a direct probe to study the physics of disk-jet coupling and the mechanisms driving relativistic outflows. We present a comprehensive analysis of the X-ray timing and spectral variability of 16 Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies detected by Fermi-LAT, based on 29 epochs of XMM-Newton observations. A moderate intraday flux variability is observed throughout the sample, with fractional variability ranging from 5 to 16\%. The temporal study of 1H\,0323+342 reveals a distinctive turnover timescale in structure functions, along with notable variations in flux and power spectral density slopes. The hardness ratio in some epochs demonstrates a clear trend of softer-when-brighter. The X-ray spectra of 1H 0323+342, PMN J0948+0022, RGB J1644+263, PKS 1502+036, and J1246+0238 are well fitted by a power-law + blackbody model, suggesting a bright disk along with a jet, and J1222+0413 is fitted by broken power-law, while the remaining sources are well fitted by a power-law model revealing the non-thermal domination. The X-ray luminosity exhibits a strong correlation with $γ$-ray and disk luminosity, and a strong correlation with the jet power, suggesting a close coupling of disk and jet. Additionally, we have found an anti-correlation between the X-ray spectral index and the X-ray luminosity, as well as with the FWHM of H$β$ line, indicating a complex interaction between the central engine, jet activity, and the accretion disk in these sources.

Abstract: Using the data from the all-sky survey in soft X-rays performed by the eROSITA telescope onboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma observatory we identified known radio and $γ$-ray pulsars in the eastern half of the sky. As a result, new candidate counterparts were found for twelve pulsars of different ages and types at a $\gtrsim$ 3$σ$ confidence level. A comparable number had been previously identified in the western half of the sky. In total, this represents about 12\% of all known pulsars already detected in X-rays. For the new counterparts, we provide estimates of their X-ray fluxes, preliminary characteristics of their X-ray spectra, and brief descriptions of the pulsars' properties. In addition, in the eastern half of the sky eROSITA detected 55 pulsars previously identified in X-rays by other telescopes.

Abstract: Modern wide-field time-domain surveys facilitate the study of transient, variable and moving phenomena by conducting image differencing and relaying alerts to their communities. Machine learning tools have been used on data from these surveys and their precursors for more than a decade, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which make predictions directly from input images, saw particularly broad adoption through the 2010s. Since then, continually rapid advances in computer vision have transformed the standard practices around using such models. It is now commonplace to use standardized architectures pre-trained on large corpora of everyday images (e.g., ImageNet). In contrast, time-domain astronomy studies still typically design custom CNN architectures and train them from scratch. Here, we explore the affects of adopting various pre-training regimens and standardized model architectures on the performance of alert classification. We find that the resulting models match or outperform a custom, specialized CNN like what is typically used for filtering alerts. Moreover, our results show that pre-training on galaxy images from Galaxy Zoo tends to yield better performance than pre-training on ImageNet or training from scratch. We observe that the design of standardized architectures are much better optimized than the custom CNN baseline, requiring significantly less time and memory for inference despite having more trainable parameters. On the eve of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time and other image-differencing surveys, these findings advocate for a paradigm shift in the creation of vision models for alerts, demonstrating that greater performance and efficiency, in time and in data, can be achieved by adopting the latest practices from the computer vision field.

Abstract: Robotic wide-field time-domain surveys, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, capture dozens of transients each night. The workflows for discovering and classifying transients in survey data streams have become increasingly automated over decades of development. The recent integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence tools has produced major milestones, including the fully automated end-to-end discovery and classification of an optical transient, and has enabled automated rapid-response space-based follow-up. The now-operational Vera C. Rubin Observatory and its Legacy Survey of Space and Time are accelerating the rate of transient discovery and producing large volumes of data at incredible rates. Given the expected order-of-magnitude increase in transient discoveries, one promising path forwards for optical time-domain astronomy is heavily investing in accelerating the automation of our workflows. Here we review the current paradigm of real-time transient workflows, project their evolution during the Rubin era and present recommendations for accelerating transient astronomy with automation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The MeerKAT Large Area Synoptic Survey (MeerKLASS) is designed to map large areas of the Southern sky for cosmology using the single-dish HI intensity mapping (IM) technique, while simultaneously delivering a wide, high angular-resolution interferometric survey. We present the design and first results of the MeerKLASS On-the-Fly (OTF) continuum data, which exploits the visibilities recorded during fast, constant-elevation scans. This observing mode enables fast commensal imaging over several hundred of square degrees on a nightly basis.
  We describe the OTF survey strategy and pipeline, focusing on handling challenges introduced by the current MeerKAT fixed-delay correlation observing mode, which causes decorrelation (smearing). We implement a correction scheme based on time-dependent phase rotation, direction-dependent PSF modeling, and wide-band faceted deconvolution with \texttt{DDFacet}. Using UHF-band and pilot L-band data, we demonstrate the recovery of high-quality 2-second snapshot images and deep mosaics over hundreds of square degrees. After smearing correction we are able to achieve a resolution of $23.3$arcsec and $14$ arcsec with an rms sensitivity of $35 μ{\rm Jy\,beam}^{-1}$ and $ 33 μ{\rm Jy\,beam}^{-1}$ in the UHF and L-band respectively.
  The full survey will cover $10,000 \, {\rm deg}^{2}$ at 544-1088 MHz, and after the delay tracking fix implemented we expect to reach $\sim 25 μ{\rm Jy\,beam}^{-1}$ at $14$ arcsec resolution. The continuum OTF data products will support diverse science goals, including galaxy and AGN evolution, diffuse cluster emission, large-scale structure and cosmology, rotation-measure synthesis, and transient searches. MeerKLASS-OTF thus establishes an efficient path to wide-area commensal surveys with MeerKAT and provides a key technical precursor for SKA-Mid.

Abstract: Finding scientifically interesting phenomena through slow, manual labeling campaigns severely limits our ability to explore the billions of galaxy images produced by telescopes. In this work, we develop a pipeline to create a semantic search engine from completely unlabeled image data. Our method leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate descriptions for galaxy images, then contrastively aligns a pre-trained multimodal astronomy foundation model with these embedded descriptions to produce searchable embeddings at scale. We find that current VLMs provide descriptions that are sufficiently informative to train a semantic search model that outperforms direct image similarity search. Our model, AION-Search, achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on finding rare phenomena despite training on randomly selected images with no deliberate curation for rare cases. Furthermore, we introduce a VLM-based re-ranking method that nearly doubles the recall for our most challenging targets in the top-100 results. For the first time, AION-Search enables flexible semantic search scalable to 140 million galaxy images, enabling discovery from previously infeasible searches. More broadly, our work provides an approach for making large, unlabeled scientific image archives semantically searchable, expanding data exploration capabilities in fields from Earth observation to microscopy. The code, data, and app are publicly available at https://github.com/NolanKoblischke/AION-Search

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Most discussion of charge-transfer-efficiency (CTE) losses involves the parallel transfer of charge in the y-direction down the chip columns (y-CTE). Serial charge-transfer efficiency (x-CTE) refers to the horizontal transer of charge. Serial CTE losses were first assessed in WFC3/UVIS in 2014 (WFC3/ISR 2014-02), where it was found that bright stars were shifted by roughly 0.0015 pixel away from the readout amplifier. Now that the WFC3/UVIS CCD has spent more than three times as long in space, imperfect serial CTE should have three times the impact on the images, so we revisit the effect and characterize serial CTE in a similar manner to our models for parallel-CTE by using a combination of warm pixels, cosmic rays, saturated stars, and overscan pixels. Overall, serial CTE has a much smaller impact on images than does parallel CTE. As of 2023, parallel CTE can have a roughly 5 percent impact on bright sources and a greater than 50 percent impact on faint sources, and serial CTE can have a roughly 1% impact on bright sources and a roughly 3 percent impact on fainter sources. The first few pixels in the serial CTE trails are much sharper than the parallel trails, but there is a very faint component to the serial trails that extends much farther than the parallel trails, even wrapping around to the next row. We develop a pixel-based model for the trapping and release of charge in the serial register and release a stand-alone beta-version of this pixel-based serial-CTE correction. Most images are not significantly impacted by the x-CTE effect, however HST users that require high-precision astrometry could benefit from this correction. At the very least, curious users can quantify its potential impact on their science.

Abstract: The millihertz band is densely populated by continuous gravitational-wave signals from Galactic compact binaries, dominated by double white dwarfs (DWDs; binaries of two white dwarfs) with contributions from systems containing neutron stars and black holes (Amaro-Seoane et al. 2023). As these binaries inspiral due to gravitational-wave radiation, they can reach contact and begin mass transfer in the millihertz band. Gravitational-wave detectors like LISA will survey such compact binaries across the Milky Way, yielding samples numbering in the tens of thousands, with essentially complete sensitivity to orbital periods shorter than ~10-20 min (e.g. Lamberts et al. 2019). Assessing the nature of the binary components - and deriving masses, temperatures and compositions - requires systematic electromagnetic characterisation that breaks gravitational-wave degeneracies and enables full atmospheric and orbital solutions. At present, no dedicated facility or coordinated survey is planned to deliver electromagnetic follow-up at the scale necessary to maximise the science return of the millihertz gravitational-wave data; this white paper discusses the need and requirements of such a capability.

Abstract: We present a comparative bibliometric analysis of eight astronomy journals over 1996--2024, including \textit{Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan} (PASJ). Using data from Scopus and SciVal, we extract annual indicators of publication activity and scholarly impact, analyze time series, citation distributions, and citation age profiles, and benchmark PASJ within this landscape. The age profiles reveal a characteristic knowledge-use cycle: citations rise over $\sim$2--4 years, approach saturation by $\sim$10--12 years, underscoring limits of short-window impact metrics. Journals published by European and North American astronomical organizations sustain higher impact, whereas PASJ generally lies below the world baseline. In parallel, PASJ shows episodic above-baseline impact through facility- or mission-driven special issues and features that, given the journal's modest annual volume, can materially shift year-level metrics. These patterns point to two potential avenues for PASJ: well-timed, thoughtfully organized special issues and features that highlight high-impact results, and continued strengthening of international collaboration.

Abstract: Bayesian imaging of astrophysical measurement data shares universal properties across the electromagnetic spectrum: it requires probabilistic descriptions of possible images and spectra, and instrument responses. To unify Bayesian imaging, we present the Universal Bayesian Imaging Kit (UBIK). Currently, UBIK images data from Chandra, eROSITA, JWST, and ALMA. UBIK is based on information field theory (IFT), the mathematical theory of field inference, and on NIFTy, a package for numerical IFT. UBIK provides sky models that are instrument independent and instrument interfaces that share common parts of their response representations. It is open source, can provide spatio-spectral image cubes, jointly analyses data from several instruments, and separates diffuse emission, point sources, and extended emission regions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Stars and planets can be seen as the second fundamental building blocks of baryons in the universe (only second to the dust and gas in molecular clouds). Their formation involves dust grain growth of many orders of magnitude and a myriad of processes operating at time scales from a few tens to millions of years. Thus, investigating the formation and evolution of young stellar objects (YSOs) is of great importance in modern astronomy. Addressing this goal requires overcoming long-standing challenges in characterizing multifaceted phenomena that span a broad range of astrophysical processes (from protoplanetary disk evolution and planet formation to accretion dynamics and transient stellar events). Also, YSOs are complex systems that consist of several components: a central forming object, surrounded by a medium or disk from which the accretion process is at work, supersonic ejection of plasma in the form of collimated bipolar jets (which interact with the ambient medium through which they propagate) and all these components emit in a wide range of wavelengths. A facility capable of simultaneously tackling these diverse questions must deliver long-term, high-cadence spectroscopic monitoring of YSOs over time spans of at least a decade; especially because accretion/ejection processes in YSOs are characterized by a wide range of temporal variability: from short-term (hours-days) to long-term (months-years) variability due to rotation, accretion, magnetic activity, etc. Such a mission demands a spectroscopic platform considering a solid time-domain astronomy framework, providing repeated observations over wide fields and supporting multiple cadence strategies tailored to distinct scientific objectives.

Abstract: Stellar magnetic activity, manifested through spots (faculae and flares), fundamentally shapes the exoplanets' environments. For low-mass stars in particular, where most habitable-zone planets reside, the variable magnetic phenomena can dominate atmospheric chemistry, surface radiation levels, long-term atmospheric escape, and ultimately habitability. However, physical characteristics of these transients (e.g. energy and temperature) and their spectra remain ill-constrained due to limitations in cadence and magnitude access of current spectroscopic facilities. A next-generation 12-m class ground-based observatory equipped with integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) and multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) at R$\sim$4,000 and $\sim$40,000 offers a transformational opportunity to characterize stellar activity in the time domain across large samples of exoplanet host stars. Such a facility would enable simultaneous monitoring of continuum variability, chromospheric and coronal line diagnostics, and particle-accelerated flare signatures, resolving the physics driving space weather and quantifying its impact on planetary atmospheres.

Abstract: Numerical methods for radiative transfer play a key role in modern-day astrophysics and cosmology, including study of the inhomogeneous reionization process. In this context, ray tracing methods are well-regarded for accuracy but notorious for high computational cost. In this work, we extend the capabilities of the Nyx N-body / hydrodynamics code, coupling radiation to gravitational and gas dynamics. We formulate adaptive ray tracing as a novel series of filters and transformations that can be used with AMReX particle abstractions, simplifying implementation and enabling portability across Exascale GPU architectures. To address computational cost, we present a new algorithm for merging sources, which significantly accelerates computation once reionization is well underway. Furthermore, we develop a novel prescription for geometric overlap correction with low-density neighbor cells. We perform verification and validation against standard analytic and numerical test problems. Finally, we demonstrate scaling to up to 1024 nodes and 4096 GPUs running multiphysics cosmological simulations, with 4096^3 Eulerian gas cells, 4096^3 dark matter particles, and ray tracing on a 1024^3 coarse grid. For these full cosmological simulations, we demonstrate convergence in terms of reionization history and post-ionization Lyman-alpha forest flux.

Abstract: The Mega-MUSE Nearby Galaxy Serendipity Survey is a White Paper in response to the ESO Expanding Horizons Call for Ideas. It is based on the notion that novel observing facilities for astronomy almost always make discoveries that were not anticipated at the time of planning and conceptual design. Unlike other surveys it is not targeting the solution of a single specific astrophysical problem, but enables the exploitation of data obtained from other surveys in Local Group and Local Volume galaxies to clarify open science questions that cannot be solved otherwise. The most prominent objectives are to obtain solid statistics of rare stars and gaseous nebulae as well as their properties that are not accessible in the Milky Way disk due to extinction and selection effects, and the discovery of as yet unknown phenomena.

Abstract: We present AttenGW, an attention-based multi-detector gravitational-wave detection model and accompanying software stack designed for analysis of real LIGO data. AttenGW combines a per-detector hierarchical dilated convolutional network with an attention-based aggregation module that enforces cross-detector coherence, providing an alternative to graph-based aggregation schemes used in previous work. The pipeline adopts a LIGO-style preprocessing and data-loading workflow based on GWOSC time series, with standard whitening and filtering, and is released as a documented Python/PyTorch package. We benchmark AttenGW using simulated injections to estimate sensitive volume and on real O3 data, focusing on the February 2020 segment previously used to evaluate a spatiotemporal graph ensemble. On this month of data, a single AttenGW model reduces the false-positive rate relative to a single graph-based detector by a factor of a few, and an ensemble of three AttenGW models matches the performance of the corresponding six-model ensemble. Injection studies on real LIGO noise further indicate that attention-based aggregation yields stable performance on non-Gaussian backgrounds.

Abstract: The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is a ground-based observatory that will improve upon the sensitivities of the current generation of very-high-energy gamma-ray instruments. The Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (SCT) is a dual-mirror candidate design for a CTAO Medium-Sized Telescope (MST). The prototype Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (pSCT) was inaugurated in 2019 at Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO) in Arizona and observed significant gamma-ray emission from the Crab Nebula with a partially populated camera. The pSCT camera is currently being upgraded to fully instrument the focal plane with 11,328 silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) pixels split between 177 camera modules. Additionally, the modules will feature upgraded electronics designed to reduce electronics crosstalk and noise. A module calibration procedure has been developed using a preproduction test module. Following this calibration procedure, performance testing shows that the upgrade module has low noise, minimal electronics crosstalk, and excellent charge resolution. After calibration and optimization, the 177 production modules will be installed in the pSCT camera for commissioning. This will be followed by observations of known VHE gamma-ray sources for camera performance validation.

Abstract: $N$-body simulation serves as a critical method for modeling cosmic evolution and represents a significant challenge in high-performance computing. We present CUBE2, a cosmological $N$-body code emphasizing memory efficiency, computational performance, scalability and precision. The core of its algorithm utilizes Particle-Mesh (PM) method to solve the Poisson equation for matter distribution, leveraging the well-optimized Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for computational efficiency. In terms of scalability, the multi-level PM spatial decomposition reduces the computational complexity to nearly linear. Precision is ensured by the optimized Green's function that seamlessly bridges gravitational interactions between multi-level PM and Particle-Particle (PP) calculations. The program design enhances per-core/node efficiency in processing $N$-body particles, while a fixed-point data storage format addresses memory constraints for large particle counts. Using CUBE2, we run two cosmological simulations with particle counts of $6144^3$ on the Advanced Computing East China Sub-center (ACECS) to test performance and accuracy.

Abstract: In this project we use data obtained by Zwicky Transient Facility to develop and test a neural-network-based, multiband classification algorithm to classify periodic variable stars (i.e. pulsating variable stars and eclipsing binaries). The aim is to utilize the algorithm on LSST data once they become available. Phase-folded light curve images and period information were used from five different variable star types: Classical and Type II Cepheids, δ Scuti stars, eclipsing binaries, and RR Lyrae stars. The data is taken from the 17th data release of ZTF, from which we used two passbands, g and r in this project. The periods were calculated from the raw data and this information was used as an additional numerical input in the neural network. For the training and testing process a supervised machine learning method was created, the neural network contains Convolutional Neural Networks concatenated with Fully Connected Layers.
  During the training-validation process the training accuracy reached 99% and the validation accuracy peaked at 95.6%. At the test classification phase three variable star types out of the 5 classes were classified with around 99% of accuracy, the other two also had very high accuracy, 89.6% and 93.6%.

Abstract: We present the extension of the differentiable hydrodynamics code, diffhydro, enabling scalable PDE-constrained inference and integrated hybrid physics-ML models for a wide range of astrophysical applications. New physics additions include radiative heating/cooling, OU-driven turbulence, and self-gravity via multigrid Poisson. We demonstrate good agreement with the Athena++ code on standard validation tests such as Sedov-Taylor, Kelvin-Helmholtz, and driven/decaying turbulence. We further introduce a solver-in-the-loop neural corrector that reduces coarse-grid errors during time integration while preserving stability. The addition of custom adjoints facilitates efficient end-to-end gradients and multi-device scaling. We present simulations up to 1024^3 elements, run on distributed GPU systems, and we show gradient-based reconstructions of complex initial conditions in turbulent, self-gravitating, radiatively cooling flows. The code is written in JAX, and the solver's modular finite-volume components are compiled by XLA into fused accelerator kernels, delivering high-throughput forward runs and tractable differentiation through long integrations.

Abstract: The closure phase, the sum of the three Fourier phases in a telescope triangle, is an important tool in astronomical interferometry, helping to reconstruct the geometries of the observed objects. While already established in amplitude interferometry, for the recently expanding field of intensity interferometers the closure phase enables recovering information of the interferometric phases that are otherwise inaccessible with this technique. To extract the (cosine of) the closure phase ($\cos φ$) in intensity interferometry, third-order correlations between three simultaneously measuring telescopes have to be computed. As the signal-to-noise of such three-photon correlations is too small for current generation intensity interferometers, no third-order correlations of astrophysical targets have been recorded so far. In this paper we present the first measurements of third order correlation functions of two stellar systems, Nunki ($σ$ Sgr) and Dschubba ($δ$ Sco), observed with the H.E.S.S. intensity interferometer in 2023. We show how to isolate the three-photon contribution term from the two-photon contributions, in order to access $\cos φ$. For the observed stellar targets the sensitivity is not high enough to extract closure phase information. To demonstrate that the analysis works well we further extract $\cos φ$ in a laboratory experiment, using the H.E.S.S. intensity interferometer and a pseudo-thermal light source.

Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are fundamental tracers of the early assembly of the Milky Way (MW). They formed in diverse environments-including both our Galaxy and dwarf galaxies- retaining chemical and dynamical signatures that encode their origins and the merger history of the Galaxy. Although significant progress has been made in characterising GC chemistry, most studies have focused on light, $α$-, and iron-peak elements. In contrast, neutron-capture (n-capture) elements remain sparsely investigated across the GC system, despite their unique ability to trace nucleosynthetic channels and star-formation timescales. A homogeneous and statistically robust mapping of n-process elements in a large sample of GCs would provide powerful constraints on their formation environments, chemical signatures of in situ and accreted systems, and refine our understanding of the early chemical evolution of the MW halo. Addressing this gap requires high-resolution, multiplexing, and blue-sensitive spectroscopy capable of accessing the full suite of n-capture diagnostics in several tens of stars per GC.

Abstract: The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics concept aims to map large areas with spectral coverage and sensitivities inaccessible to previous FIR space telescopes, covering 25-235um. We synthesise images representing a deep imaging survey, with realistic instrumental and confusion noise, reflecting the latest PRIMAger instrument specifications. We present a new Bayesian modelling approach XID+stepwise that exploits PRIMAger's hyperspectral imaging to derive self-consistent, informative flux priors by sequentially propagating constraints from short to long wavelengths. With Euclid-like prior source positions, this method recovers fluxes to within 20% to 0.2-0.7 mJy across 45-84 um, which correspond to factors of 1.3-3.4 fainter than the confusion limit. For the most confusion-dominated channels, accurate fluxes are measured to 0.9, 2.5, 7.6 and 14.8 mJy at 92, 126, 183 and 235 um, respectively, which are factors of 3-5 better than the confusion limit. Using a deeper Euclid-based prior catalogue and weak ancillary flux priors at 25 um yields further improvements, reaching up to a factor ~7 fainter than the confusion limit at 96 um. Additionally, we demonstrate that positional priors from blind source detection followed by deblending via XID+ enables PRIMAger to achieve sensitivity beyond the confusion limits using PRIMAger data alone. We show that IR-luminous galaxies at z~2 are robustly detected in a large fraction of the PRIMAger channels (>98% in 12 out of the 16 considered channels), providing dense sampling of the FIR SED even for sources several factors below the confusion limit. We explore the impact on our results for a range of systematic effects, including cirrus contamination, optical degradation, and calibration uncertainties. These findings indicate that confusion noise will not limit the key science from PRIMA extragalactic imaging surveys when employing XID+.

Abstract: I construct an Einstein-Cartan ekpyrotic model (ECEM): a homogeneous, nearly Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background in Einstein-Cartan (EC) gravity whose spin-torsion sector, modeled phenomenologically as a Weyssenhoff fluid with stiff scaling $\propto a^{-6}$, is coupled to a scalar field with a steep exponential potential that interpolates between a negative ekpyrotic branch and a positive plateau. Extending the Copeland-Liddle-Wands (CLW) scalar-fluid dynamical system to a six-dimensional phase space including shear, curvature, and spin-torsion, I recast the equations in a compact deceleration-parameter form, compute the full Jacobian, and evaluate maximal Lyapunov exponents. Numerical solutions show that the ekpyrotic branch ($w_φ\gg1$) exponentially damps homogeneous shear, while the softened branch ($w_φ<1$) allows $ρ_s$ to overtake the scalar during contraction and trigger a torsion-supported bounce at high but finite densities where the EC spin-torsion term becomes dynamically dominant. Scans in a two-parameter softening plane $(φ_{\rm b},Δ)$ identify a finite region of nonsingular trajectories and quantify the required tuning; in the parameter ranges explored the maximal Lyapunov exponent on the constrained phase space is negative, giving no indication of chaotic behavior in this homogeneous truncation even when the usual curvature mode that destabilizes contracting General Relativity (GR) backgrounds is included. The construction is purely phenomenological and confined to homogeneous backgrounds: it does not address entropy accumulation, the cosmological arrow of time, or a complete cyclic cosmology.

Abstract: The study of periodic orbits in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals is essential for understanding the dynamics of small bodies orbiting supermassive black holes. In this paper, we study the periodic orbits and their corresponding gravitational wave emissions within the framework of an effective field theory-based extension of general relativity (EFTGR), which incorporates higher-order curvature terms into the Einstein-Hilbert action. We start with a brief analysis of the modified black hole spacetime in EFTGR and examine how its parameters influence the dynamics of a massive neutral particle using the Lagrangian formalism. Focusing on the impact of the higher-order curvature terms in EFTGR, we examine the properties of periodic orbits, which are characterized by three topological integers $(z, w, v)$ that uniquely classify their trajectories. By analyzing these orbits within EFTGR, we aim to provide new insights into how strong-field deviations from general relativity may manifest in observable phenomena. We then calculate the gravitational waveforms generated by these periodic orbits, identifying potential observational signatures. Our analysis reveals a direct connection between the zoom-whirl orbital behavior of the small compact object and the gravitational waveforms it emits: higher zoom numbers lead to increasingly intricate waveform substructures. The results contribute to a clearer understanding of the dynamical features of EFTGR and open new avenues for probing black hole properties via gravitational wave detection.

Abstract: A relativistic self-gravitating equilibrium system with spherical symmetry as well as with steady energy flow is investigated perturbatively around the hydrostatic limit, where the radial component of the fluid velocity field $u^μ$ is sufficiently small. Each component of vectors and tensors consisting of the system is expanded in different powers, which makes the covariant perturbation approach ineffective. The differential equations to determine the subleading correction of the structure variables are presented. The system retains the current $j^μ$ accounting for the steady flow, which contributes to the entropy current $s^μ$ in such a general covariant form that $s^μ=au^μ+ bj^μ$ with $a, b$ unknown parametric functions. To determine them, a new condition is proposed. This condition imposes the entropy current to be of an unconventional form $s^μ=(s-bj^0)u^μ/u^0+ bj^μ$, where $s$ is the entropy density. The remaining parameter $b$ is fixed by the current conservation equation. The perturbative analysis shows that $b$ starts with the quadratic order and its leading term is determined explicitly.

Abstract: Gravitational wave echoes serve as probes for quantum horizon corrections. While steady-state resonances are assumed in the search of gravitational wave echos, realistic barriers are expected to possess intrinsically low reflectivity. In this work, we investigate this low-finesse limit via time-domain simulations and demonstrate that early-time echoes behave as transient scattered wave packets rather than cavity eigenstates. A central finding is the identification of spectral drift, where the central frequency progressively redshifts. This evolution occurs because high-frequency components dissipate significantly faster than the fundamental mode due to the filtering effect of the potential barrier. To distinguish transient interference from genuine resonance, we establish a physical criterion based on cavity lifetime, identifying a critical reflectivity threshold of approximately $0.37$. Since theoretical models typically operate deep within the overdamped regime below this limit, the resulting signals are spectrally non-stationary. We propose that detection strategies should shift towards dynamic time-frequency tracking to capture these drifting signatures.

Abstract: We present a fully analytical solution to the dynamics of the non-spinning 2.5 post-Newtonian binary problem, accounting for both the long-term (secular) and short-term (oscillatory) temporal behavior, with no restriction on eccentricity. The radiative degrees of freedom are handled within the nonconservative Hamiltonian framework introduced in a companion paper. In this work, we apply the Lie series method to construct a resonant Birkhoff normal-form and the corresponding generator of the radiation-reaction dynamics. The secular piece reconstructs exactly the Peters-Mathews relations for semi-major axis and eccentricity. The oscillatory piece completes the dynamics and is well suited for gravitational wave templates. The procedure we present in this paper can be systematically employed to cast arbitrary nonconservative systems into extended Hamiltonian form so that the Lie method can be applied.

Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic and optical properties of Einstein-Born-Infeld-Anti-de Sitter (EBI-AdS) black holes (BHs). Our study derives the Hawking temperature using standard surface gravity methods and examines quantum corrections through both the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and exponential entropy modifications, showing enhanced thermal radiation and potential remnant formation scenarios. The gravitational redshift analysis separates contributions from mass, cosmological constant, electromagnetic charge, and Born-Infeld (BI) corrections, with the latter scaling as $a^4/r^6$ and thus confined to near-horizon regimes. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we calculate light deflection angles in both vacuum and plasma environments, demonstrating how dispersive media can either enhance or suppress nonlinear electrodynamic signatures depending on observational configurations. The thermodynamic analysis in extended phase space, where the BH mass corresponds to enthalpy, reveals phase structures with heat capacity transitions between positive and negative values, indicating regions of local stability and instability sensitive to parameter choices. We study BH heat engines operating in rectangular thermodynamic cycles, achieving efficiencies of $η\sim 0.11$--$0.21$ that reach 30--61\% of the corresponding Carnot limits, consistent with other AdS BH systems. Comparison with Johnson's analysis confirms that BI corrections to heat engine efficiency are of order $10^{-12}$ for typical parameter ranges, though these effects become appreciable in the strong-field regime where $r_h \lesssim 1.5$ in Planck units. The plasma deflection analysis reveals frequency-dependent refractive modifications encoded in the plasma parameter, offering additional possible observational channels.

Abstract: Physical aspects of a static solution to the Einstein equations
  with two black holes are studied via ray tracing. The exact
  solution for this double Schwarzschild solution is known in explicit form. The black holes are separated by a singularity called \emph{Weyl strut}. The effect of this strut on null geodesics is shown to be defocusing in contrast to the focusing effect of the black holes. It is shown that black holes with a large separation essentially lead to similar behavior of the null geodesics as a single black hole, whereas nearby holes display a widely changed behavior due to the Weyl strut.

Abstract: The relativistic precession model (RPM) is widely-considered as a benchmark framework to interpret quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), albeit several observational inconsistencies suggest that the model remains incomplete. The RPM ensures \emph{structureless test particles} and attributes precession to geodesic motion alone. Here, we refine the RPM by incorporating the internal structure of rotating test bodies, while preserving the test particle approximation (TPA), and propose a \emph{macroscopic precession model} (MPM) by means of the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) equations, applied to a Schwarzschild background, which introduces 1) a shift in the Keplerian frequency and 2) an \emph{effective spin correction} to the radial epicyclic frequency that, once the spin tensor is modeled, reproduces a quasi-Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) correction. We apply the MPM to eight neutron star low mass X-ray binaries (NS-LMXBs), performing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fits to twin kHz QPOs and find observational and statistical evidence in favor of precise power law spin reconstructions. Further, our model accurately predicts the $3:2$ frequency clustering, the disk boundaries and the NS masses. From the MPM model, we thus conclude that complexity of QPOs can be fully-described including the test particle internal structure.

Abstract: Geodesic flows emanating from an arbitrary point $\mathscr{P}$ in a manifold $\mathscr{M}$ carry important information about the geometric properties of $\mathscr{M}$. These flows are characterized by Synge's world function and van Vleck determinant - important bi-scalars that also characterize quantum description of physical systems in $\mathscr{M}$. If $\mathscr{P}$ is a regular point, these bi-scalars have well known expansions around their flat space expressions, quantifying \textit{local flatness} and equivalence principle. We show that, if $\mathscr{P}$ is a singular point, the scaling behavior of these bi-scalars changes drastically, capturing the non-trivial structure of geodesic flows near singularities. This yields remarkable insights into classical structure of spacetime singularities and provides useful tool to study their quantum structure.

Abstract: We investigate the cosmological inflation for the Einstein-Hilbert action plus the Higgs potential function and the Gauss-Bonnet term coupled with the Higgs scalar field through a dilaton-like coupling. Then, using the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric and considering the appropriate slow-roll parameters, we derive the necessary equations of motion. In the proposed model, since the e-folding integral cannot be easily solved analytically, we first utilize a well-known Taylor expansion. Then, with a certain range of values derived for the model parameters, utilizing a mixture of several diagrams and numerical analysis methods, we obtain results for the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the scalar spectral index that are in good agreement with observational data within the acceptable range of the e-folding values. Also, in the absence of the Gauss-Bonnet term, we find that the inflationary observables are roughly the same as the predictions of the chaotic inflation model.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the equation of state and its properties of the perfect fluid in the $D$-dimensional FRW universe under Einstein gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity and Lovelock gravity. In Einstein gravity, we get the equation of state and find that it has no critical point in the $P$-$V$ diagram, but its isothermal lines have minima in the $4$-dimensional case and are always negative in higher dimensions. In Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we get the equation of state and find that it has a critical point in the $5,6,7,8$-dimensional cases with phase transitions above the critical temperature. In Lovelock gravity, we get the equation of state and conditions of the critical points. Our work shows that both the theories of gravity and the dimensions of the FRW universe affect the existence of the critical point of the perfect fluid. Interestingly, if the critical point exists, phase transition always occures above the critical temperature.

Abstract: Efficient searches for gravitational waves from compact binary coalescence are crucial for gravitational wave observations. We present a proof-of-concept for a method that utilizes a neural network taking an SNR map, a stack of SNR time series calculated by the matched filter, as input and predicting the presence or absence of gravitational waves in observational data. We demonstrate our algorithm by applying it to a dataset of gravitational-wave signals from stellar-mass black hole mergers injected into stationary Gaussian noise. Our algorithm exhibits comparable performance to the standard matched-filter pipeline and to the machine-learning algorithms that participated in the mock data challenge, MLGWSC-1. The demonstration also shows that our algorithm achieves reasonable sensitivity with practical computational resources.

Abstract: We construct the Kerr/CFT correspondence for extremal Kerr--Bertotti--Robinson (Kerr--BR) black holes, which are exact stationary solutions of the Einstein--Maxwell equations describing a rotating black hole immersed in a uniform Bertotti--Robinson electromagnetic universe. After reviewing the geometry, horizon structure, and thermodynamics of the Kerr--BR family, we demonstrate that the external field non-trivially modifies both the horizon positions and the extremality condition. For extremal configurations, the near-horizon limit yields a warped $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ geometry with an associated Maxwell field aligned to the $U(1)$ fibration. Imposing standard Kerr/CFT boundary conditions, the asymptotic symmetry algebra gives rise to a Virasoro algebra with central charge $c_L$ and left-moving temperature $T_L$ that depend explicitly on the external field strength. The Cardy formula then reproduces exactly the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy of the extremal Kerr--BR black hole for any admissible value of the Bertotti--Robinson field, thereby establishing a consistent Kerr/CFT dual description. Comparisons with the magnetized Melvin--Kerr and Kaluza--Klein black holes are briefly discussed, highlighting qualitative differences in their curvature profiles and horizon geometries.

Abstract: This work analyzes the Darmois junction conditions matching an interior Alcubierre warp drive spacetime to an exterior Minkowski geometry. The joining hypersurface requires that the shift vector of the warp drive spacetime must satisfy the solution of a particular inviscid Burgers equation, namely, the gauge where the shift vector is not a function of the $y$ and $z$ spacetime coordinates. Such a gauge connects the warp drive metric to shock waves via a Burgers-type equation, which was previously found to be an Einstein equations vacuum solution for the warp drive geometry. It is also shown that not all Ricci and Riemann tensors components are zero at the joining hypersurface, but for that to happen they depend on the shift vector solution of the inviscid Burgers equation at the joining wall. This means that the warp drive geometry is not globally flat.

Abstract: Traversable wormholes are one of the most exciting predictions of General Relativity that offer short-cuts through space-time. However, their feasibility requires the violation of the null energy condition and makes their detection a bit difficult. This paper aims to show the new avenues delving deep into the observational prospects of TWHs via quasinormal modes (QNMs) and gray body factors GBFs. These are the two elementary aspects of wave dynamics. Given their distinct spectral imprints, these features provide a potential means to distinguish wormholes from black holes in gravitational wave observations. The role of QNMs in characterizing the ringdown phase of perturbations and the GBFs in determining transmission probabilities through wormhole barriers have been explored by a general description and then fed to Einstein Gauss Bonnet WH solutions in isotropic as well as anisotropic cases. Finally, a correspondence of the QNM frequencies with radius of the WH shadows has been made and the effect of Gauss Bonnet parameter on the QNM spectra has been discussed.

Abstract: Here, we explore the effect of the cloud of strings (CoS) on the gravitational waveforms of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). The EMRI system consists of a supermassive black hole (BH) and a compact stellar mass object moving around it. We begin with studying the test particle motion around the Schwarzschild BH surrounded by a CoS by using the Lagrangian formalism. Moreover, we investigated the effect of the CoS parameter on the evolution of the semi-latus rectum and eccentricity. We then turn to the exploration of the impact of the CoS parameter on the gravitational waveforms of the EMRI system. The analysis performed shows that Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) could detect the CoS imprint in gravitational waveforms when the values of the string cloud parameter $α\gtrsim 2 \times 10^{-6}$.

Abstract: As a contribution towards the understanding for the field equations of diffeomorphism invariant theories of pure gravity, we demonstrate in great detail that the expression for the field equations of such theories can be derived within the perspective of the surface term coming from the variation of the Lagrangian. Specifically, starting with the surface term, we extract a symmetric rank-two tensor together with an anti-symmetric one out of this term with the variation operator replaced with the Lie derivative along an arbitrary vector field. By utilizing an equality stemming from the Lie derivative of the Lagrangian density along an arbitrary vector field, it is proved that the resulting symmetric rank-two tensor is identified with the functional derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to the metric. Such a result further brings forth the expression for the field equations constructed from the symmetric rank-two tensor, which naturally rules out the derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to the metric and coincides with the one for the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion. Furthermore, it is illustrated that the construction of the expression for the field equations from the symmetric rank-two tensor must be feasible as long as the variation operator in the variation equation of the Lagrangian is allowed to be substituted by the Lie derivative along an arbitrary vector field. On the other hand, as a byproduct, the anti-symmetric rank-two tensor turns out to be the Noether charge two-form. Our results offer a straightforward support on the proposal in our previous work that the surface term gives a unified description for field equations and Noether charges in the context of theories of gravity admitting diffeomorphism invariance symmetry.

Abstract: This paper investigates photon motion in black hole of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory, exploring black hole shadows and observational characteristics under various accretion models. We first give the relation of the event horizon, photon sphere, and critical impact parameter in terms of the magnetic charge $q$. We then use the Event Horizon Telescope data to constrain $q$. For the two spherical accretion models, the infalling scenario yields a darker shadow due to the Doppler effect. However, the shadow radius remains unchanged for different models. In the case of an optically thin, geometrically thin disk accretion model, the observed brightness is predominantly determined by direct emission. The lensing ring provides a secondary contribution to the intensity, whereas the photon ring's emission is negligible. The widths of the lensing and photon rings exhibit a positive correlation with the magnetic charge $q$. Additionally, within the disk model framework, the black hole shadow radius is found to depend on the specific emission model.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a dangerous journey -- a journey through the strong singularity from one universe to another or from inside of a black hole to its 'inverse' as a white hole. Such singularities are hidden in the Friedman and Schwarzschild solutions; we call them malicious singularities. The journey is made possible owing to two generalizations. The first generalization consists in considering spaces with differential structures on them (the so-called ringed spaces) rather than the usual manifolds. This entails a generalization of the concept of smoothness, which allows us to think about a smooth passage through the singularity. The second generalization is related to the concept of curve. We show that if a kind of singularity is implanted in the set of curve's parameters, along with an appropriate topology, in such a way that the structure of the set of parameters corresponds to the structure of the singular space-time, the curve can smoothly -- in a generalized sense -- pass through the singularity.

Abstract: We study the influence of the plasma environment on the shadows of stationary axisymmetric wormholes. We consider a sample of several wormhole solutions and plasma distributions for which the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the light rays is separable. This allows us to derive analytical expressions for the shadow boundary and examine the behavior of the photon regions as the plasma frequency varies. We observe that plasma profiles which depend only on radial coordinate lead to common evolution of the photon region which does not depend on the wormhole metric and is consistent with the Kerr black hole. For plasma profiles with angular dependence the evolution of the photon region is specific for every spacetime thus wormholes are observationally distinguishable. We further investigate the formation of forbidden regions in the plasma medium where light cannot propagate. They lead to the formation of plasma frequency ranges where the shadow is no longer observable and we show that this phenomenon is characteristic for all the configurations in our sample. We obtain the critical frequencies for which the shadow vanishes and demonstrate that for all the wormholes they are lower than the critical frequencies for the Kerr black hole in the same environment. This implies that there exist plasma frequency ranges in which the Kerr black hole casts a shadow but wormholes do not, creating a strong observational signature for discriminating between compact objects. In the frequency ranges where both black hole and wormhole shadows exist the wormhole shadows are consistently smaller than those for the Kerr black hole. As the plasma frequency grows the discrepancy progresses showing that plasma medium facilitates the experimental detection of wormholes. Finally we consider aberrational effects on the wormhole shadows. They further increase the deviation from black holes making wormholes easier to detect.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamic behavior of a horizonless compact object within the framework of Rastall-Rainbow (RR) gravity. Working with local shell thermodynamics for gravastar and an exterior fiducial temperature, we show that the RR modification bends temperature to produce two extrema and a stable mass remnant at zero temperature. We show that the gravastar's shell entropy is smaller than that of a comparable black hole, and that RR modifications introduce a logarithmic correction which contributes to specific heat positivity and a smoother free energy landscape of small gravastars.
  A Central finding of this work is that, from heat capacity and Helmholtz free energy analyses, we uncover small, middle, and large branches and demonstrate that unlike Rainbow modified black holes, the small RR gravastar is both locally and globally favored over hot curved space. At the parameter level, both Rastall and Rainbow play distinct roles. Increasing the Rastall parameter, by strengthening matter-curvature coupling, adjusts the redshift between the shell and the exterior, shifts the temperature maximum to higher values at larger masses, and narrows the unstable window. In contrast, increasing the Rainbow parameter enhances energy dependent UV suppression and bends the temperature in lower values at larger masses. Altogether, these results highlight a controlled route to thermodynamic stabilization and the emergence of a stable remnant in horizonless compact objects within RR gravity.

Abstract: One of the main technical obstacles in constructing a consistent theory of quantum gravity is that the metric itself defines the causal structure required for quantization. This motivates implementing quantum aspects of gravity through an independent connection. Moreover, the experimentally confirmed violation of Bell inequalities, together with the natural structure of the energy--momentum tensor in semiclassical gravity, suggests that nonlocality should be incorporated into the gravitational formalism. Motivated by these considerations, we propose a model in which the connection is treated as an independent bitensorial field, leading to a bitensorial generalization of the Einstein equations. The model reduces to General Relativity when the matter source is classical. We apply it in two regimes: the late-time universe and the Newtonian limit. In the cosmological case, the model naturally gives rise to a positive effective cosmological constant. In the Newtonian regime, we analyze a situation in which the gravitational source is in a quantum superposition and find that the model predicts a novel, nonconservative effective force that depends on the velocity of the test particle.

Abstract: Newtonian noise (NN) from seismic density fluctuations is expected to limit the low-frequency sensitivity of third-generation gravitational-wave detectors, in particular the Einstein Telescope (ET). Current NN mitigation relies on seismometer arrays and Wiener filtering, while distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) offers a complementary, low-cost means of obtaining dense strain measurements. We investigate fusion sensor arrays composed of both displacement-measuring seismometers and strain-measuring DAS-type sensors. We extend the Wiener filter formalism to mixed sensor types and introduce analytic S-wave strain correlation coefficients. Using a hybrid differential evolution and covariance matrix adaptation scheme, we validate our approach against established seismometer-only results and analyze the geometry, robustness, and performance of optimized fusion arrays. Fusion arrays enhance P/S-wave disentanglement and achieve NN cancellation levels comparable to, and sometimes exceeding, those of seismometer-only arrays, particularly for small sensor numbers. When sensors are constrained to the ET infrastructure, we find that six seismometers complemented by fourteen strainmeters inside the ET arms can match the performance of twenty seismometers in boreholes, achieving a residual at the 10% level, and thereby offering a cost-efficient pathway toward ET-scale NN mitigation.

Abstract: This article explores the cosmological scenario in which our Universe contains a hidden thin-shell configuration. We investigate a degenerate modification of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric obtained through a coordinate transformation applied to the radial coordinate, analogous to recent approaches that address the Big Bang singularity via spacetime defects. The resulting metric, while formally satisfying the standard homogeneous Friedmann equations, actually describes an evolving wormhole geometry with two asymptotically flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker regions connected by a throat located at the coordinate singularity. Using Israel's junction formalism, we demonstrate that this coordinate singularity corresponds to a thin shell characterized by exotic matter with well-defined surface energy density and isotropic pressure. The shell obeys the barotropic equation of state $p = -ρ/2$, confirming the presence of exotic matter that violates the standard energy condition, which is a requirement for maintaining wormhole geometries. As the universe expands, this thin shell becomes increasingly diluted, scaling as $1/a(t)$ with the cosmic scale factor.

Abstract: In the present paper, we study a Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) quantum cosmology model with positively curved spatial sections. The matter content of the model is given by a radiation fluid, a Chaplygin gas, and an ad hoc potential. After writing the Hamiltonian of the model, we notice that the effective potential ($V_{eff}$) depends on three parameters: $A$ and $B$ associated with the Chaplygin gas, and $σ$ associated with the ad hoc potential. Depending on the values of these parameters $V_{eff}$ becomes a double barrier potential. We quantize the model and obtain the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We solve that equation using the WKB approximation and compute the corresponding probability ($TP_{WKB}$) that the wavefunction of the universe tunnels through the double barrier potential $V_{eff}$. We study how $TP_{WKB}$ behaves as a function of the parameters $A$, $B$, $σ$ and the radiation energy $E$. We notice a significant occurrence of resonances in $TP_{WKB}$ when varying it as a function of $E$ or $σ$. It is a very interesting phenomenon because it may cause the universe to be born with selected values of $E$ or $σ$.

Abstract: Motivated by the finiteness of de Sitter (dS) horizon entropy, we study how ``bra-ket wormholes'' modify correlation functions in gravitationally prepared states. Euclidean wormhole saddles in gravitational path integrals can generate non-factorizing contributions to correlation functions, as in replica-wormhole explanation of the Page curve and bra-ket-wormhole restoration of strong subadditivity. By defining `time' variables and computing observables in a flat region attached to the dS boundary, we evaluate bra-ket wormhole contributions to scalar two-point functions and find a late-time transition in the dominant saddle, accompanied by ramp-and-plateau behavior of correlations and characteristic timescale comparable to the fast scrambling. Our results are built upon (i) inflationary horizon exit and re-entry, (ii) enhancement of correlation at small comoving momentum $k$ by wormhole contribution, and (iii) a competition between mode counting and topological suppression that drives a transition to wormhole dominance. Although results are qualitatively consistent, one needs to address wormhole stabilization to clearly interpret in terms of the entropy context.

Abstract: Schrödinger symmetry emerged in a ``fluid limit" from a full superspace to several mini-superspace models. We consider two spherically-symmetric static mini-superspace models with matter fields and verify the robustness of this emergent symmetry at the classical level: (i) Maxwell field with cosmological constant and (ii) $n$ massless scalar fields. We develop a method based on canonical transformations and show that: for model (i), 3D Schrödinger symmetry emerges, and the solution is the (anti-) de Sitter Reissner-Nordström spacetime, and for model (ii), $(2+n)$D Schrödinger symmetry appears, and the solution is a generalized Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime and its ``interior", a Kantowski-Sachs type closed universe. In the matter decoupling limit, both cases lead to 2D Schrödinger symmetry in different lapse functions and mini-superspace coordinates, which implies the covariance of Schrödinger symmetry. Finally, we propose a physical interpretation of the symmetry under Hamiltonian constraints $H$ and explain it with examples: Symmetry generators commuting with $H$ map a solution to another one, while those non-commuting with $H$ generate a new theory with the Schrödinger symmetry and the transformed configuration is a solution to the new theory. These support the robustness of the emergence of Schrödinger symmetry and open new possibilities for exploring quantum dynamics of matter and gravity based on the symmetry.
