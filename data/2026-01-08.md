Abstract: We present the most general and exact solution of Einstein's gravity sourced by an anisotropic fluid describing the cosmological embedding (CE) of a static and spherically-symmetric object, including black holes (BHs) or exotic compact objects, without radial energy influx and in an arbitrary Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology. This is done fully considering backreaction of the local geometry on the cosmological dynamics. Our solution is free of curvature singularities at the would-be BH event horizon, thus solving a main issue of the CE of BH solutions proposed so far. As a byproduct, we derive a new CE of the Schwarzschild BH - distinct from McVitties's original proposal - that is regular everywhere except at the central singularity.

Abstract: We present the IMRPhenomXE frequency-domain phenomenological waveform model for the dominant mode of inspiral-merger-ringdown non-precessing binary black holes in elliptical orbits. IMRPhenomXE extends the quasi-circular IMRPhenomXAS waveform model for the dominant $(\ell, |m|) =$ (2,2) modes to eccentric binaries. For the inspiral part, orbit-averaged equations of motion within the quasi-Keplerian parametrization up to third post-Newtonian order, including spin effects, are evolved, and the waveform modes are computed using the stationary phase approximation on eccentricity expanded expressions up to $\mathcal{O}(e^{12})$. The model assumes circularization at merger-ringdown, where it adopts the underlying quasicircular IMRPhenomXAS baseline. We show that IMRPhenomXE reduces to the accurate IMPhenomXAS model in the quasi-circular limit. Compared against 186 public numerical relativity waveforms from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes catalog with initial eccentricities up to $~0.8$, IMRPhenomXE provides values of unfaithfulness below $3\%$ for $72\%$ of simulations with initial eccentricities below 0.4. For larger eccentricities, the unfaithfulness degrades up to $\gtrsim 10\%$ due to the underlying small eccentricity expansions and additional modelling approximations. In terms of speed, IMRPhenomXE outperforms any of the existing inspiral-merger-ringdown eccentric waveform models. We demonstrate the efficiency, robustness, and modularity of IMRPhenomXE through injections into zero noise and parameter-estimation analyses of gravitational-wave events, showing that IMRPhenomXE is a ready-to-use waveform model for gravitational-wave astronomy in the era of rapidly growing event catalogs.

Abstract: We investigate superradiant scattering off a rotating regular black hole described by a black-bounce metric which generalizes the Kerr spacetime of mass $M$ and specific angular momentum $a$ through a regularization parameter $p$ and two deformation exponents $(k,n)$. Focusing on massless $(\ell,m)=(1,1)$ scalar modes, we explore the parameter space and compute amplification factors by numerically integrating the separated radial Klein-Gordon equation. We track the peak amplification and the corresponding frequency across the $(a/M,p/M)$ parameter space for several combinations of $k$ and $n$. We find that increasing $n$ systematically enhances superradiance, whereas increasing $k$ tends to suppress it. In particular, certain configurations yield amplification levels up to 98% larger than the maximum amplification for standard Kerr black holes.

Abstract: This study evaluates the capability of future multi-band observations of gravitational waves emitted from binary black hole coalescences, utilizing joint third-generation ground-based (CE, ET) and space-based (LISA, Taiji, TianQin) detector networks, to constrain parity and Lorentz symmetry violations in the gravitational sector. We model these effects through a parameterized waveform framework that incorporates a set of parameters that quantify potential deviations from general relativity. The frequency-dependence of their effects is described by power-law indices $β$ (i.e., $β_{\bar ν}$, $β_{\bar μ}$, $β_ν$, and $β_μ$). By analyzing events such as a high-signal noise ratio (SNR) "golden event" like GW250114 and a massive binary system like GW231123 (total mass $190-265 M_\odot$) using two networks of ground- and space-based detectors, we demonstrate that multi-band observations can significantly improve the current constraints on Lorentz and parity violations by several order of magnitude, for both high-frequency ($β> 0$) and low-frequency ($β< 0$) modifications. Our Bayesian analysis reveals that while the exceptional SNR of the GW250114-like event yields superior constraints for high-frequency modifications ($β> 0$), the massive nature of GW231123 provides more stringent limits for low-frequency effects ($β< 0$). This work highlights the critical value of future multi-band gravitational wave astronomy for conducting precision tests of general relativity across diverse binary populations.

Abstract: It is known that there exist theoretical limits on the mass of compact objects in general relativity. One is the Buchdahl limit for an object with an arbitrary equation-of-state that turns out to be the limit for an object with uniform density. Another one is the causal limit that is stronger than the Buchdahl limit and is related to the speed of sound inside an object. Similar theoretical limits on the mass of compact objects in deformed Hořava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity are found in this \paper. Interestingly, the both curves of the uniform density limit and the sound speed limit meet the horizon curve at the minimum of the horizon, where a black hole becomes extremal, i.e., $M=q$, considering the Kehagias-Sfetsos vacuum that is an asymptotic flat solution in the HL gravity.

Abstract: We investigate how a Hernquist type dark matter (DM) halo, parametrized by its core radius $r_{s}$ and central density $ρ_{s}$, influences both the gravitational wave (GW) emission from timelike periodic orbits and the electromagnetic appearance of a thin accretion disk around a Schwarzschild black hole (BH). By analyzing the effective potential for timelike geodesics, we show that the DM halo shifts the marginally bound orbit (MBO) and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) outward, reflecting its modification of the spacetime geometry and the energy-angular momentum structure of particle motion. Employing a semi-analytical method, we compute orbital trajectories and the associated GW waveforms, revealing that the DM halo alters the characteristic zoom-whirl dynamics and induces measurable changes in waveform morphology. Furthermore, we generate direct and secondary images of the accretion disk across various observer inclinations and find that increasing $r_{s}$ or $ρ_{s}$ results in cooler, dimmer disks with modified flux distributions. Our results demonstrate that the presence of a DM halo imprints distinct signatures in both gravitational and electromagnetic observables, offering a multimessenger pathway to probe DM environments near BHs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to have a source rich data stream containing signals from large numbers of many different types of source. This will include both individually resolvable signals and overlapping stochastic backgrounds, a regime intermediate between current ground-based detectors and pulsar timing arrays. The resolved sources and backgrounds will be fitted together in a high dimensional Global Fit. To extract information about the astrophysical populations to which the sources belong, we need to decode the information in the Global Fit, which requires new methodology that has not been required for the analysis of current gravitational wave detectors. Here, we %start that development, presenting present a hierarchical Bayesian framework to infer the properties of astrophysical populations directly from the output of a LISA Global Fit, consistently accounting for information encoded in both the resolved sources and the unresolved background. Using a simplified model of the Global Fit, we illustrate how the interplay between resolved and unresolved components affects population inference and highlight the impact of data analysis choices, such as the signal-to-noise threshold for resolved sources, on the results. Our approach provides a practical foundation for population inference using LISA data.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In cosmology, long-wavelength modes are related to large-gauge transformations (LGT), i.e. changes of coordinates that modify the physical geometry of the cosmological patch. These LGTs stand as bona-fide symmetries of cosmological perturbation theory with various applications, from consistency relations constraining cosmological correlators to non-linear conservation laws in the separate-universe approach. In this work, we revisit LGTs and derive two new results. First, we show that the global symmetries already identified in the literature can be extended to local infinite-dimensional symmetries. The associated generators depend on arbitrary functions of time, and generate low-multipole modes that modify the mean curvature energy and the angular momentum of the patch, demonstrating their physical nature. We propose to interpret these low-multipole soft modes as a new cosmological-frame ambiguity that needs to be fixed prior to evaluating cosmological observables. Second, we demonstrate that the adiabatic cosmological perturbations generated by LGTs deform but preserve all the explicit and hidden Killing symmetries of the background geometry. As such, long-wavelength modes stand as a concrete example of algebraically-special cosmological perturbations of Petrov-type O, and inherit the conformal group as isometries and a set of four deformed Killing-Yano tensors and their associated Killing tensors. This opens the possibility to study their effect on cosmological observables in a fully analytic manner.

Abstract: We propose a mechanism for the generation of gravitationally bound dark photon halos during the matter-dominated era. Coupled to an ultralight axion field through a parity-violating Chern-Simons term, dark photons can be produced by the tachyonic instability of axion coherent oscillation. The dark photons with a net helicity lead to a metric vorticity and can generate chiral substructures. For axion masses in the range $10^{-28} \, \mathrm{eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-22} \, \mathrm{eV}$, the resulting inhomogeneities collapse to form halos with masses spanning $M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^5 \, M_{\odot}$ to $10^{11} \, M_{\odot}$, with halo sizes ranging from $O(1)$ to $O(10^{6}) \, \mathrm{pc}$. During halo collapse, the induced vorticity could mediate efficient angular-momentum transport, which enables monolithic collapse and provides primordial seeds for the early formation of supermassive black holes.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Consider an $(N+1)$-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime and a future-directed, affinely parametrized outgoing null generator $γ$ of an achronal boundary $\partial J^+(S_\varepsilon)$, where $\{S_\varepsilon\}$ is a nested family of smooth compact codimension $2$ surfaces approaching a singular boundary set $S$ in the past. In the twist-free case and under the null energy condition, the Raychaudhuri equation on the $m:=N-1$ dimensional screen bundle reads, $$ θ'=-\frac1mθ^2-\|σ\|^2-\mathrm{Ric}(k,k), $$ where $k$ is the tangent to $γ$. This equation linearizes, via the rescaling $u:=A^{1/m}$ with $A := |\det D|$ the Jacobi-map $m$-volume, to the Sturm-type ODE $$ u''+\frac1m f\,u=0,\qquad f:=\|σ\|^2+\mathrm{Ric}(k,k)\ge 0. $$ We develop two purely generator-wise criteria forcing a first zero of $u$: (i) an exact Volterra identity combined with concavity leads to a barrier-weighted integral inequality, and (ii) Sturm comparison and a Prüfer-angle estimate yields failure of disconjugacy whenever $\int_c^d \sqrt{f/m}\,dλ>π$ on a subinterval. We prove that $u(λ_\ast)=0$ is equivalent to the existence of a focal (conjugate) point and implies $θ= m u'/u\to-\infty$ at $λ_\ast$. Using the standard structure of achronal boundaries, this yields a geodesic-wise obstruction: if every generator that could reach $\mathscr I^+$ satisfies one of the above conditions in the regular spacetime region, then $J^+(S_\varepsilon)\cap \mathscr I^+=\emptyset$, and hence $S$ is not globally visible. As an application, we illustrate one of these criteria in the Einstein-massless scalar field collapse model of Christodoulou.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel approach for identifying, constructing, and validating precise and accurate universal relations for neutron star bulk quantities. A central element is simulation-based inference (SBI), which we adopt to treat uncertainties due to the unknown nuclear equation of state (EOS) as intrinsic non-trivial noise. By assembling a large set of bulk properties of non-rotating neutron stars across multiple state-of-the-art EOS models, we are able to systematically explore universal relations in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Our framework further identifies the most promising parameter combinations, enabling a more focused and traditional construction of explicit universal relations. At the same time, SBI does not rely on explicit relations; instead, it directly provides predictive distributions together with a quantitative measure of systematic uncertainties, which are not captured by conventional approaches. As an example, we report a new universal relation that allows us to obtain the radius as a function of mass, fundamental mode, and one pressure mode. Our analysis shows that SBI can surpass the predictive power of this universal relation while also mitigating systematic errors. Finally, we demonstrate how universal relations can be further calibrated to mitigate systematic errors accurately.

Abstract: It has long been thought that black hole accretion flows are driven by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, and there are now many general relativistic global simulations illustrating the dynamics of this process. However, many challenges must be overcome in order to predict observed spectra from luminous systems. Ensuring energy conservation, local thermal balance, and local ionization equilibrium, our post-processing method incorporates all the most relevant radiation mechanisms: relativistic Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung, and lines and edges for 30 elements and all their ions. Previous work with this method was restricted to black holes of $10 M_\odot$; here, for the first time, we extend it to $10^8 M_\odot$ and present results for two sub-Eddington accretion rates and black hole spin parameter 0.9. The spectral shape predicted for stellar-mass black holes matches the low-hard state for the lower accretion rate and the steep power law state for the higher accretion rate. For high black hole mass, both accretion rates yield power-law continua from $\sim 0.5 - 50$~keV whose X-ray slopes agree well with observations. For intermediate mass black holes, we find a soft X-ray excess created by inverse Compton scattering of low-energy photons produced in the thermal part of the disk; this mechanism may be relevant to the soft X-ray excess commonly seen in massive black holes. Thus, our results show that standard radiation physics applied to GRMHD simulation data can yield spectra reproducing a number of the observed properties of accreting black holes across the mass spectrum.

Abstract: Luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) are a growing class of enigmatic energetic transients. They show fast rises and declines, high temperatures throughout their evolution, and non-thermal emission in radio and X-rays. Their power source is currently unknown, but proposed models include engine-driven supernovae, interaction-powered supernovae, shock cooling emission, intermediate mass black hole tidal disruption events (IMBH TDEs), and Wolf-Rayet/black hole mergers, among others. AT2024wpp is the most optically luminous LFBOT to date and has been observed extensively at multiple wavelengths, including radio, optical, UV, and X-rays. We take models from multiple scenarios and fit them to the AT2024wpp optical, radio, and X-ray light curves to determine if which of these scenarios can best describe all aspects of the data. We show that none of the multiwavelength light curve models can reasonably explain the data, although other physical arguments favour a stellar mass/IMBH TDE of a low mass star and a synchrotron blast wave. We discuss how this scenario can be tested with late-time observations, and what other scenarios could possibly explain the broadband data.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A central magnetar engine is commonly invoked to explain energetic supernovae, which should have multiple signals in multiwavelength emission. Photoionization from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) can create distinct spectroscopic signals in the nebular phase. Recent models suggest infrared emission, particularly from Ne II, can be prominent at late times. This work examines the cooling power of optical and infrared transitions to determine which lines contribute strongly to cooling and on what timescale. The models show infrared cooling becomes strong at $\sim$ 3 years post-explosion and dominates by 6 years, with [Ne II] 12.8$μ$m being the strongest coolant. The fraction of total cooling in the infrared increases sharply once the PWN luminosity decreases below 10$^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and this fraction also increases with increasing ejecta mass and decreasing average PWN photon energy. However, the emission from [Ne II] 12.8$μ$m increases with increasing PWN luminosity and increasing ejecta mass. Cooling at 1 year is dominated by optical O and S lines, with infrared Ar, Ni, and Ne lines becoming strong at 3 years. Optical cooling is almost negligible at 6 years, with the supernova cooling almost entirely through mid- and far-infrared transitions. JWST spectroscopy with MIRI should be able to detect these lines out to $z \sim 0.1$. Supernovae with higher magnetic fields transition to infrared cooling on earlier timescales, while infrared-dominated supernovae should have strong emission from neutral atoms and emit strongly in radio at sub-decade timescales.

Abstract: There is growing evidence from gravitational-wave observations that some merging black holes are created from previous mergers. Using the prediction that these hierarchically-merged black holes have dimensionless spin magnitudes of $χ\approx 0.69$, we identify a subpopulation in the gravitational-wave data consistent with a hierarchical-merger origin in dense star clusters. This subpopulation's primary mass distribution peaks at $16.7^{+3.1}_{-4.6},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, which is approximately twice as large as its secondary mass distribution's mode ($8.0^{+29.7}_{-2.3},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), and its spin tilt distribution is consistent with isotropy. Our inferred secondary mass distributions imply that isolated binary evolution may still be needed to explain the entirety of the $9\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak. Surprisingly, we find that the rate of hierarchical mergers may evolve more steeply with redshift than the rest of the population ($98.5\%$ credibility): the fraction of all binary black holes that are hierarchically formed at $z=0.1$ is $0.05^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$, compared to $0.17^{+0.13}_{-0.12}$ at $z=1$. This provides an explanation for the previously-discovered broadening of the effective spin distribution with redshift. Our results have implications for star cluster formation histories, as they suggest the potential existence of a high-redshift population of massive, compact clusters.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) are thought to be primarily associated with binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. The SGRB population can therefore be scrutinized to look for signatures of the delay time between the formation of the progenitor massive star binary and the eventual merger, which could produce an evolution of the cosmic rate density of such events whose shape departs from that of the cosmic star formation history (CSFH). To that purpose, we study a large sample of SGRBs within a hierarchical Bayesian framework, with a particular focus on the delay time distribution (DTD) of the population. Following previous studies, we model the DTD either as a power-law with a minimum time delay or as a log-normal function. We consider two models for the intrinsic SGRB luminosity distribution: an empirical luminosity function (ELF) with a doubly broken power-law shape, and one based on a quasi-universal structured jet (QUSJ) model. Regardless of the chosen parametrization, we find average time delays $10\lesssim \langle τ_\mathrm{d}\mathrm\rangle/\mathrm{Myr}\lesssim 800$ and a minimum delay time $τ_\mathrm{d,min}\lesssim 350\,\mathrm{Myr}$, in contrast with previous studies that found long delay times of few Gyr. We demonstrate that the cause of the longer inferred time delays in past studies most likely resides in an incorrect treatment of selection effects.

Abstract: Pulsars are the most numerous class of Galactic gamma-ray sources detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Young pulsars occasionally experience sudden timing discontinuities called glitches, characterized by rapid changes in rotational parameters, usually followed by a return to regular rotation. PSR J2021+4026 is unique among Fermi-LAT pulsars, exhibiting quasiperiodic switches between two states with varying spin-down rates approximately every 3-4 years, correlated with sudden changes in gamma-ray emission features. This study searched for gamma-ray emission variability in pulsars correlated with glitch occurrence. We introduced a novel approach to analyzing LAT gamma-ray pulsars through systematic examination of variability associated with spin-down rate changes. We tracked rotation and gamma-ray emission changes for seven promising glitches selected based on observed spin-down rate variations. Using 14 years of Fermi-LAT data, we conducted binned likelihood spectral analysis of data windows around selected glitch epochs. We improved best-fit parameter precision by incorporating likelihood weights calculated from diffuse background models, accounting for systematic error contributions. The phase-averaged flux and spectral parameters of analyzed pulsars showed no significant variation across investigated glitches. The 95% upper limits on relative flux change indicate the Vela pulsar flux is unchanging, with a 0.5% upper limit on relative change, making it promising for further searches. The connection between glitch dynamics and gamma-ray emission remains unclear, and PSR J2021+4026 remains unique in its gamma-ray variability properties. We conclude that comprehensive investigation of glitches is warranted to further unravel their underlying mechanisms.

Abstract: Scorpius X-1 (Sco X-1) is a neutron star X-ray binary in which the neutron star is accreting rapidly from a low mass stellar companion. At radio frequencies, Sco X-1 is highly luminous and has been observed to have jet ejecta moving at mildly relativistic velocities away from a radio core, which corresponds to the binary position. In this Letter, we present new radio observations of Sco X-1 taken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. Using a fast imaging method, we find that the 10 and 15GHz data show a number of flares. We interpret these flares as the possible launching of fast jets ($βΓ$>2), previously observed in Sco X-1 and called ultra-relativistic flows, and their interaction with slower moving jet ejecta. Using the period between successive flares, we find that it is possible for the fast jets to remain undetected, as a result of the fast jet velocity being sufficiently high to cause the jet emission to be beamed in the direction of the motion and out of our line of sight. Our findings demonstrate that the ultra-relativistic flows could be explained by the presence of fast jets in the Sco X-1 system.

Abstract: High-density and high-Z crystals are a key element of most space-borne $γ$-ray telescopes operating at GeV energies (such as Fermi-LAT). The lattice structure is usually neglected in the development of a crystalline detector, although its effects on the energy deposit development should be taken into account, since the interactions of a high energy ($\sim$~GeV) photon or e$^\pm$ impinging along the axis of an oriented crystal are different than the ones observed in a fully isotropic medium. Specifically, if the angle between a photon (e$^\pm$) trajectory and the crystal axis is smaller than $\sim$ 0.1$^\circ$, a large enhancement of the pair production (bremsstrahlung) cross-section is observed. Consequently, a photon-induced shower inside an oriented crystal develops within a much more compact region than in an amorphous medium. Moreover, for photon energies above a few GeV and incidence angles up to several degrees, the pair-production cross-section exhibits a pronounced dependence on the angle between the crystal axis and the photon polarization vector. \\ In this work we show that these effects could be exploited to develop a novel class of light-weight pointing space-borne $γ$-ray telescopes, capable of achieving an improved sensitivity and resolution, thanks to a better shower containment in a smaller volume with respect to non-oriented crystalline detectors. We also show that an oriented tracker-converter system could be used to measure the polarization of a $γ$-ray source above few GeV, in a regime that remains unexplorable through any other detection technique. This novel detector concept could open new pathways in the study of the physics of extreme astrophysical environments and potentially improve the detector sensitivity for indirect Dark Matter searches in space.

Abstract: Regardless of their initial spins, the merger of two roughly equal mass black holes (BHs) produces a remnant BH of dimensionless spin $0.69$. Such remnants can merge with other black holes in dense stellar environments and produce hierarchical mergers. Analyzing the latest catalog binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors, we identify a subpopulation with primary spins consistent with such hierarchical mergers. Consistent with astrophysical expectations for mergers of second generation BHs with first generation BHs, we find that this subpopulation has mass ratios below $0.59^{+0.18}_{-0.23}$. We also infer that $19$-$88\%$ of the BBH population below this mass ratio is consistent with belonging to the hierarchically-merged population. Our results offer a natural explanation for the narrowing of the effective inspiral spin distribution with mass ratio observed in other studies.

Abstract: Motivated by a number of X-ray observations of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that exhibit a potential signature of ultra-fast inflows (UFIs), we consider in this work a scenario that UFIs can be physically identified as weakly-magnetized hydrodynamic accretion flows that is guided and channeled by poloidal magnetic field into low-to-mid latitude above the equatorial disk. In the context of general relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) under a weak-field limit in Kerr spacetime, we present a set of preliminary results by numerically calculating the physical property of GRHD flows (e.g. kinematics and density distribution) in an effort to simulate redshifted absorption line spectra. Our model demonstrates that such GRHD accretion off the equatorial plane (i.e. $v \gsim 0.1c$ where $c$ is the speed of light in the vicinity of AGN closer than $\sim 100$ \sw radii) can manifest itself as UFIs in the form of redshifted absorption signature assuming the observed characteristics such as column density of $N_H \sim 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ and ionization parameter of $\log (ξ\rm{[erg~cm~s^{-1}])} \sim 3$ as also seen in recent multi-epoch {\it NuSTAR} observations among other data.

Abstract: Observing supernovae (SNe) in the early Universe (z > 3) provides a window into how both galaxies and individual stars have evolved over cosmic time, yet a detailed study of high-redshift stars and SNe has remained difficult due to their extreme distances and cosmological redshifting. To overcome the former, searches for gravitationally lensed sources allow for the discovery of magnified SNe that appear as multiple images - further providing the opportunity for efficient follow-up. Here we present the discovery of "SN Eos": a strongly lensed, multiply-imaged, SN II at a spectroscopic redshift of z = 5.133 +/- 0.001. SN Eos exploded in a Lyman-α emitting galaxy when the Universe was only ~1 billion years old, shortly after it reionized and became transparent to ultraviolet radiation. A year prior to our discovery in JWST data, archival HST imaging of SN Eos reveals rest-frame far ultraviolet (~1,300Å) emission, indicative of shock breakout or interaction with circumstellar material in the first few (rest-frame) days after explosion. The JWST spectroscopy of SN Eos, now the farthest spectroscopically confirmed SN ever discovered, shows that SN Eos's progenitor star likely formed in a metal-poor environment (<= 0.1 Z_{\odot}), providing the first direct evidence of massive star formation in the metal-poor, early Universe. SN Eos would not have been detectable without the extreme lensing magnification of the system, highlighting the potential of such discoveries to eventually place constraints on the faint end of the cosmic star-formation rate density in the very early Universe.

Abstract: The long GRB 180728A, at a redshift of $z = 0.1171$, stands out due to its high isotropic energy of $E_{γ,iso} \sim 2.5 \times 10^{51}$ erg, in contrast with most events at redshift $z<0.2$. We analyze the properties of GRB 180728A's prompt emission, afterglow, and associated supernova SN 2018fip, comparing them with other GRB-SN events. This study employs a dense photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of the afterglow and the SN up to 80 days after the burst, supported by image subtraction to remove the presence of a nearby bright star, and modelling of both the afterglow and the supernova. GRB 180728A lies on the $E_{p,i}-E_{γ,iso}$ plane occupied by classical collapsar events, and the prompt emission is one of the most energetic at $z < 0.2$ after GRB 030329 and GRB 221009A. The afterglow of GRB 180728A is less luminous than that of most long GRBs, showing a shallow early phase that steepens around 5 hours (0.2 days). The GRB exploded in an irregular, low-mass, blue, star-forming galaxy, typical of low-z collapsar events. Because of the relatively faint afterglow, the light curve bump of SN 2018fip dominates the optical emission already after $\sim$3 days and is one of the best sampled to date. The strong suppression below $\sim$ 4000 angstrom and a largely featureless continuum in the early 6--9 days spectra favor aspherical two-component ejecta with a high-velocity collimated component ($> 20,000 km s^{-1}$), dominant early-on, and a more massive, low-velocity component, which dominates at much later epochs. Our findings indicate that asymmetries need to be considered in order to better understand GRB-SNe. In any case, SN 2018fip shares many characteristics with typical GRB-SNe. Its kinetic energy is below the common range of $10^{52}-10^{53}$ erg and does not correlate with the high energy of the GRB, highlighting the diversity of the GRB-SN energy budget partition.

Abstract: We present MARVEL (https://ligogpt.mit.edu/marvel), a locally deployable, open-source framework for domain-aware question answering and assisted scientific research. It is designed to address the increasing demands of a digital assistant for scientific groups that can read highly technical data, cite precisely, and operate within authenticated networks. MARVEL combines a fast path for straightforward queries with a more deliberate DeepSearch mode that integrates retrieval-augmented generation and Monte Carlo Tree Search. It explores complementary subqueries, allocates more compute to promising branches, and maintains a global evidence ledger that preserves sources during drafting. We applied this framework in the context of gravitational-wave research related to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. Answers are grounded in a curated semantic index of research literature, doctoral theses, LIGO documents, and long-running detector electronic logbooks, with targeted web searches when appropriate. Because direct benchmarking against commercial LLMs cannot be performed on private data, we evaluated MARVEL on two publicly available surrogate datasets that capture comparable semantic and technical characteristics. On these benchmarks, MARVEL matches a GPT-4o mini baseline on literature-centric queries and substantially outperforms it on detector-operations content, where domain retrieval and guided reasoning are decisive. By making the complete framework and evaluation datasets openly available, we aim to provide a reproducible foundation for developing domain-specific scientific assistants.

Abstract: Thermal electron measurements in space plasmas typically suffer at low energies from spacecraft emissions of photo- and secondary electrons and from charging of the spacecraft body. We examine these effects by use of numerical simulations in the context of electron measurements acquired by the Electron Analyser System (SWA-EAS) on board the Solar Orbiter mission. We employed the Spacecraft Plasma Interaction Software to model the interaction of the Solar Orbiter spacecraft with solar wind plasma and we implemented a virtual detector to simulate the measured electron energy spectra as observed in situ by the SWA-EAS experiment. Numerical simulations were set according to the measured plasma conditions at 0.3~AU. We derived the simulated electron energy spectra as detected by the virtual SWA-EAS experiment for different electron populations and compared these with both the initial plasma conditions and the corresponding real SWA-EAS data samples. We found qualitative agreement between the simulated and real data observed in situ by the SWA-EAS detector. Contrary to other space missions, the contamination by cold electrons emitted from the spacecraft is seen well above the spacecraft potential energy threshold. A detailed analysis of the simulated electron energy spectra demonstrates that contamination above the threshold is a result of cold electron fluxes emitted from distant spacecraft surfaces. The relative position of the break in the simulated spectrum with respect to the spacecraft potential slightly deviates from that in the real observations. This may indicate that the real potential of the SWA-EAS detector with respect to ambient plasma differs from the spacecraft potential value measured on board. The overall contamination is shown to be composed of emissions from a number of different sources and their relative contribution varies with the ambient plasma conditions.

Abstract: Optical polarimetry provides information on the geometry of the emitting region, the magnetic field configuration and the properties of dust in astrophysical sources. Current state-of-the-art instruments typically have a small field of view (FoV), which poses a challenge for conducting wide surveys. We propose the construction of the Large Array Survey Telescope Polarization Node (LAST-P), a wide-field array of optical polarimeters. LAST-P is designed for high-cadence ($\lesssim 1$ day) polarization monitoring of numerous astrophysical transients, such as the early phases of gamma-ray bursts, supernovae, and novae. Furthermore, LAST-P will facilitate the creation of extensive polarization catalogs for X-ray binaries and white dwarfs, alongside a large FoV study of the interstellar medium. In survey mode, LAST-P will cover a FoV of 88.8 deg$^2$. With a 15 x 1-minute exposure, the instrument will be capable of measuring polarization of sources as faint as Gaia Bp-magnitude $\sim$20.9. The precision on the linear polarization degree (PD) will reach 0.7\%, 1.5\%, and 3.5\% for sources with magnitudes 17, 18, and 19, respectively, for a seeing of 2.7 arcsec, air mass of about 1 for observations in dark locations. We propose three distinct non-simultaneous survey strategies, among them an active galactic nuclei (AGN) strategy for long-term monitoring of $\sim$200 AGN with $<$1-day cadence. In this paper, we present the predicted sensitivity of the instrument and outline the various science cases it is designed to explore.

Abstract: We identify a polarization rotation systematic in the far field beams of refractive cosmic microwave background (CMB) telescopes caused by differential transmission in anti-reflection (AR) coatings of optical elements. This systematic was identified following the development of a hybrid physical optics method that incorporates full-wave electromagnetic simulations of AR coatings to model the full polarization response of refractive systems. Applying this method to a two-lens CMB telescope with non-ideal AR coating, we show that polarization-dependent transmission can produce a rotation of the far-field polarization angle that varies across the focal plane with a typical amplitude of 0.05-0.5 degrees. If ignored in analysis, this effect can produce temperature to polarization leakage and Stokes Q/U mixing.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) is increasingly promoted as a key element of modern spectrum policy, driven by the rising demand from commercial wireless systems and advances in spectrum access technologies. Passive radio sciences, including radio astronomy, Earth remote sensing, and meteorology, operate under fundamentally different constraints. They rely on exceptionally low interference spectrum and are highly vulnerable to even brief radio frequency interference. We examine whether DSS can benefit passive services or whether it introduces new failure modes and enforcement challenges. We propose just-in-time quiet zones (JITQZ) as a mechanism for protecting high value observations and assess hybrid frameworks that preserve static protection for core passive bands while allowing constrained dynamic access in adjacent frequencies. We analyze the roles of propagation uncertainty, electromagnetic compatibility constraints, and limited spectrum awareness. Using a game theoretic framework, we show why non-cooperative sharing fails, identify conditions for sustained cooperation, and examine incentive mechanisms including pseudonymetry-enabled attribution that promote compliance. We conclude that DSS can support passive radio sciences only as a high-reliability, safety-critical system. Static allocations remain essential, and dynamic access is viable only with conservative safeguards and enforceable accountability.
