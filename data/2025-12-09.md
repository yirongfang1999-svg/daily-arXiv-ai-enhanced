Abstract: We investigate the shadow of a rotating braneworld black hole in dispersive plasma environments and assess the potential of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations to constrain braneworld gravity. The spacetime around a rotating braneworld black hole is modelled by a Kerr-Newman-like metric determined by its mass $M$, spin $a$, and tidal charge $q$, which encodes the gravitational effects of the bulk spacetime. We consider both inhomogeneous and homogeneous plasma environments characterized by plasma parameters $α_i$ ($i=1,2\text{ and }3$) to study light propagation and the interplay of the background spacetime and the plasma environment in influencing the shadow size and shape. We find that as the plasma density increases, inhomogeneous plasma environments decrease the shadow size, however homogeneous plasma enlarges it. On studying the effect due to background spacetime we find that $q<0$ (negative tidal charge) increases the shadow diameter, while $q>0$ decreases it. Using the EHT measurements of M87* and Sgr A*, we constrain the $(q,α_i)$ parameter space. The EHT data constrains the tidal charge in the range $-1.15 \lesssim q \lesssim 0.45$ for M87* and $-0.65 \lesssim q \lesssim 0.8$ for Sgr A* in the low density plasma limit. As the plasma density increases, the data exhibits a preference towards negative tidal charge for inhomogeneous plasma environments and positive tidal charge for homogeneous plasma environments. Our study reveals that the size of the shadow is primarily governed by the background geometry in presence of low density plasma environments such as that observed in M87* and Sgr A*. However, if supermassive blackholes are surrounded by high density plasma then the shadow size is dictated by both the background metric and the plasma environment.

Abstract: Between the estimated population of Neutron Stars (NSs) and the actual number present in the catalogs, there is a huge gap: O(10$^{8-9}$) vs O(10$^3$). Among the different search techniques for Continuous gravitational waves (CWs), the all-sky could help to reduce the discrepancy. We focus on the all-sky CW pipeline Frequency Hough (FH), which operates without prior knowledge of the source parameters ($f,\dot{f}, λ, β$). Here, we present a Machine Learning strategy, diverging from the standard follow-up(FU) of the FH pipeline. We study the performance with real interferometer data, until reaching $h$ value subthreshold for the standard FU procedure ($CR_{thr}=5$), with encouraging classification results.

Abstract: Tidal Love numbers characterize the conservative, static response of compact objects to external tidal fields. Remarkably, these quantities vanish identically for asymptotically flat black holes in four-dimensional General Relativity. This behavior has been attributed to hidden symmetries -- both geometric and algebraic -- governing perturbations in these space-times. Interestingly, a similar vanishing of selected multipolar Love numbers arises in the context of supersonic acoustic flows. These systems share several key features with black holes in General Relativity, such as the presence of an effective acoustic horizon and a wave equation describing linear excitations. In this work, we explore a symmetry-based connection between the two frameworks and demonstrate that the ladder symmetries observed in acoustic black holes can be traced to structural properties of the underlying wave equation, mirroring those found in general relativistic black hole space-times.

Abstract: The recent observations of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) indicated the possibility that the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ might change from $w<-1$ to $w>-1$ when the redshift $z\sim 0.5$, which is called the inverse phantom crossing. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of the phantom crossing, and we construct realistic models realizing the crossing in the framework of the scalar--Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet gravity and ghost-free $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity. We also investigate the scenario of the apparent phantom crossing, where dark matter energy density decreases more slowly than usually expected, which might explain the DESI observations. In the scenarios developed, the energy conditions are not violated by any component of the cosmic fluid. In the framework of the apparent phantom crossing, we also propose a new scenario, where the particle corresponding to the scalar field in the scalar--Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet gravity is dark matter. The mass of the particle might increase due to the coupling with the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, which makes the decrease of the dark matter energy density slower. This last scenario may suggest that the inverse phantom crossing might be related to the transition from the decelerating expansion of the Universe to the accelerating expansion.

Abstract: This paper presents a concise review of the quantum tunneling approach to Hawking radiation, covering its theoretical foundations, extensions, and experimental efforts. We begin by outlining the Hamilton-Jacobi and Parikh-Wilczek methods, which provide a semi-classical framework for deriving Hawking radiation from stationary black holes. The discussion is then extended to dynamical black holes, where evolving horizons require modified treatments incorporating trapping horizons, Kodama vectors, and dynamical surface gravity. We explored the possible tunneling paths for particles crossing the horizon in dynamical black holes and emphasized the crucial role of the imaginary part of the action in determining the Hawking temperature. In the second part, we review experimental investigations of Hawking radiation, including analogue black hole experiments, quantum simulations, and astrophysical searches for primordial black hole evaporation. While no direct detection of Hawking radiation has been achieved, recent advances in Bose-Einstein condensates, optical analogues, and superconducting qubits offer indirect support for the tunneling interpretation of black hole evaporation.

Abstract: We deal with a problem concerning a supposed inconsistency in the special relativistic treatment of the so-called linear Sagnac effect. It is shown that, under modern clothes, the root of the difficulty perceived by some authors lies in their uneasiness with the standard solution of the twin paradox. In particular, since the linear Sagnac effect is an absolute effect, no tinkering with conventionality of simultaneity, so far as it preserves the physical content of special relativity, would get us out of the supposed trouble.

Abstract: GW200105 is the first gravitational wave detection to show signs of eccentricity, it also is a neutron star - blackhole binary. This raises the need for waveforms that incorporate tidal effects on quasi-elliptic orbits. We tackle the problem of finite size effects within the post-Newtonian framework, including the mass-type quadrupole and octupole, as well as the current-type quadrupole deformations in the adiabatic approximation. The computations are performed at the second-and-a-half relative post-Newtonian order. We first derive the quasi-Keplerian parametrization of the conservative motion; we then express the radial separation and phase with their time derivatives in terms of the orbital frequency, the time eccentricity and the eccentric anomaly. To obtain these as functions of time, we invert the generalized Kepler equation while also discussing the convergence of eccentricity expanded results. We provide those results to the fourteenth order in eccentricity. Finally, we exploit the already known radiation reaction term of the acceleration in order to derive the secular and oscillatory evolutions of the orbital elements. The companion paper contains the derivation of the radiated fluxes and the amplitude modes of the strain. All relevant results are provided in an ancillary file.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Modified Chaplygin Gas (MCG) model is revisited to examine its ability to describe the full cosmic evolution within a single framework. Because the field equations are highly nonlinear, no closed analytical solution for the scale factor in terms of cosmic time exists. To address this limitation and determine the flip time along with other physical characteristics, we introduce an alternative first order approximation that yields an exact analytical expression for the scale factor. This approach gives rise to an emergent, non singular cosmological scenario in which the universe begins with a finite minimum size and evolves smoothly from a quasi static phase to a de Sitter like expansion at late times, naturally approaching the LambdaCDM limit. Using Hubble observational data, we constrain the equation of state parameters and obtain the viable ranges 0 < alpha < 1 and 0 < A < 1/3. The effective equation of state parameter evolves from a positive value in the early matter dominated era to approximately minus one at late times, consistent with observations. A complementary analysis based on the Raychaudhuri equation further supports the robustness of the model.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We revisit the global structure of the extended Kerr spacetime and of a broader class of Kerr-type spacetimes possessing ring singularities. By working with the elementary analytic extension (the union of the interior and exterior regions glued across the disk), we show that excising the ring singularity yields a domain that can be realised as a branched double cover of an exterior Kerr region. The branch locus is the ring itself, and the associated deck transformation defines a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$-action that exchanges the two sheets ($r>0$ and $r<0$) of the spacetime.
  We give a covering-space characterisation of this double-sheeted structure and show that admissible geodesics which cross the ring singularity implement the non-trivial deck transformation. In particular, we prove a parity-of-crossings property: any admissible geodesic that traverses an even number of ring singularities returns to its original sheet, while an odd number of traversals terminates on the opposite sheet.
  Generalising to $N$ disjoint ring singularities, we prove that the fundamental group of the excised manifold is the free group $F_N$ generated by simple loops around each ring, and we classify the associated double covers. Identifying the physically distinguished cover where every ring induces a sheet exchange, we extend the parity-of-crossings theorem to the multi-ring setting. We then formally extend these results to the maximal analytic extension (the infinite Carter--Penrose chain), proving that the sheet-exchange mechanism applies globally to this infinite structure.
  Finally, applying the Novikov self-consistency principle to this topological framework, we demonstrate that the requirement of global consistency restricts admissible histories to discrete sectors labelled by ring-crossing parities.

Abstract: Rotating black holes can form dense boson clouds through superradiant instability, making Kerr black holes a powerful probe of ultralight massive bosons. Previous studies of black hole superradiance have often treated bosonic fields classically, leaving open questions about how particles are produced and how the clouds grow over time. In this work, we canonically quantize a massive scalar field around a Kerr black hole, providing a fully quantum description of black hole superradiance. We show that the evolution of the particle number in the cloud, as well as the energy and angular momentum of the scalar field, can be consistently explained within the standard framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. Furthermore, we prove that the growth of the cloud occurs independently of the choice of initial state. We also explore several phenomena related to a massive scalar field in a rotating black hole spacetime, including Hawking radiation, adiabatic backreaction on the black hole spin, and the direction of level transitions in the presence of self-interactions of the field. Our analysis provides a consistent quantum-mechanical perspective that includes all these phenomena.

Abstract: For the charge management system in gravitational wave detection missions, a continuous discharge strategy is considered by continuously illuminating a test mass (TM) with weak light in such a way to strike a balance between the charging and discharging rates and at the same time avoids the requirement for frequent activation of charge measurements. Built on experiments by one of us based on a simple parallel plate model for inertial sensor, in the present work a more sophisticated inertial sensor model that mimics the surface properties and work function of a cubical TM of an inertial sensor in space (like that of the LISA Pathfinder) is employed to study bipolar charge management system that utilizes UV-LEDs with peak wavelengths of 269 nm, 275 nm, 280 nm, and 295 nm that are longer than the standard 255 nm commonly employed for direct TM illumination. Experimental results indicate that the 275 nm UV-LED achieves optimal performance, maintaining the TM potential closer to zero and at the same time accommodates both rapid discharge and continuous discharge strategies. The present work provides useful input in the future study of system design and optimization for the charge management system.

Abstract: With regard to the observed dark matter density profile in galaxies and clusters, the scalar dark matter scenario has been previously studied for potential detectability through gravitational wave observations at measurable signal-to-noise ratios. In the present study, we consider the case of dark matter described by a massive vector field, also referred to as the Proca field. The density profile in the vicinity of the black hole is explicitly constructed for a broad range of dark matter mass, $μ\sim 10^{-10}-10^{-15}{\mathrm eV}$, which allows it to exhibit both particle and wave-like characteristics. While in the particle regime, the computation of the DM density distribution is analytically tractable, we find it convenient to compute the same numerically in the wave regime. Nevertheless, in the outer region, the surrounding dark matter is assumed to follow a broken power-law distribution, represented by a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile with a central spike. For the purpose of investigating the detectability of the vector dark matter in the gravitational wave spectrum, we have modelled a stellar-mass black hole ($1M_{\odot}$) inspiralling into a Schwarzschild black hole of mass $10^4M_{\odot}$ within such a vector dark matter environment. With this setup, we analyzed the dephasing in the gravitational wave strain induced by vector dark matter and performed a Fisher forecast for upcoming LISA observations, with particular emphasis on the distinctive features in both the particle and wave regimes of the dark matter. Additionally, most of the important results have been compared with the scalar dark matter case.

Abstract: We study perturbations of Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes in semi-open systems by using the Heun functions. For the semi-open system, a partially reflective wall is added around the event horizon. Three aspects of this model are investigated, namely the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra, the greybody factor (GF), and the exceptional point (EP). For the QNM aspect, we identify three distinct behaviors as the frequency-independent reflectivity $\mathcal{K}$ increasing. The first-type modes approach the real axis and form long-lived quasi-bound states. The second-type modes move toward but do not reach the real axis and retain a finite decay rate. The third-type modes eventually lie on the imaginary axis becoming purely decaying modes. For the GF aspect, GFs exhibit strong oscillations controlled by the distance between the potential and the reflective wall with a real constant reflectivity. In contrast, a Boltzmann-type reflectivity produces only small corrections. Finally, by promoting $\mathcal{K}$ to a complex parameter, the modified boundary conditions give rise to a second-order EP. Parameterizing the vicinity of such EP, we observe the mode exchange phenomenon, and the deviation of spectra scale with the square root of the deviation of the parameter, as predicted by a Puiseux series expansion.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We develop a first-order formulation of the field equations in f(R) gravity governing the global evolution of a (possibly massive) scalar field under spherical symmetry. Our formulation allows us to pose the characteristic initial value problem and to establish several properties of solutions. More precisely, we work in generalized Bondi-Sachs coordinates and prescribe initial data on an asymptotically Euclidean, future light cone with vertex at the center of symmetry, and we identify the precise regularity conditions required at the center. Following and extending Christodoulou's approach to the Einstein-massless scalar-field system, we recast the f(R) field equations as an integro-differential system of two coupled, first-order, nonlocal, nonlinear hyperbolic equations, whose principal unknowns are the scalar field and the spacetime scalar curvature. In deriving this reduced two-equation system, we identify the regularity conditions at the center of symmetry and impose natural assumptions on the scalar-field potential and on the function f(R) governing the gravitational Lagrangian density. As an application, we prove the monotonicity of the Hawking mass in this setting and formally analyze the singular limit in which the integrand f(R) of the action approaches R, corresponding to the Einstein-Hilbert action. Hence, the formulation isolates the essential evolution and constraint content on the future domain of dependence of two null hypersurfaces and is designed to facilitate subsequent advances in geometric analysis and robust numerical simulations of spherical collapse in modified gravity.

Abstract: We prove the Angular Momentum Penrose Inequality for axisymmetric vacuum initial data satisfying the dominant energy condition. This inequality establishes a sharp lower bound on the ADM mass in terms of both the horizon area and the Komar angular momentum of a black hole, with equality achieved precisely by the Kerr solution. The proof combines four main ingredients: solving an axisymmetric Jang equation where twist enters as a lower-order perturbation, establishing conformal factor bounds via a divergence identity, proving angular momentum conservation along level sets using de Rham cohomology, and applying the proven Dain-Reiris area-angular momentum inequality for sub-extremality. The monotonicity of a combined area-angular momentum functional along the Agostiniani-Mazzieri-Oronzio flow yields the result. This provides the first geometric inequality incorporating both horizon area and angular momentum, with implications for cosmic censorship, black hole thermodynamics, and gravitational wave observations of spinning black holes.

Abstract: A number of recent papers have claimed to construct solutions of Einstein's equations describing black holes surrounded by dark-matter halos with empirically motivated density profiles such as the Navarro-Frenk-White, Burkert, Einasto, pseudo-isothermal, and solitonic distributions. We show that the approach used to obtain many of these metrics generically does not lead to the correct solutions to the Einstein equations for the matter sources they purport to represent. This issue originates from applying the Newtonian relation between the tangential velocity and the enclosed mass directly within a relativistic framework, followed by the ad hoc assumption $g(r)=f(r)$ for the metric functions. This procedure leads to an anisotropic fluid with $P_r=-ρ$ and $P_t=-rρ'/2-ρ$, whose density differs from the claimed halo profile and often becomes non-physical near the horizon, violating the weak energy condition. As a result, the obtained spacetimes do not describe black holes embedded in known galactic halos but rather distinct anisotropic configurations unrelated to the intended matter distribution. We demonstrate this problem on several representative examples from the literature, including metrics based on the NFW, Burkert, Einasto, solitonic, pseudo-isothermal, and Dehnen-(1,4,5/2) profiles, as well as the case of the NGC~4649 halo. For each case, the correct Einstein-consistent form of the metric and the associated physical interpretation are provided. Our analysis clarifies the limits of validity of the Newtonian approximation near compact objects and establishes a consistent framework for constructing dark-matter-inspired black-hole geometries within General Relativity.

Abstract: By applying Noether symmetry methods, analytic solutions are obtained for a generalized Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet model with a $ξ(φ)f(G)$ component. Variation with respect to the metric, supplemented by small perturbations, produces the equations of motion and the terms that determine the propagation speed of tensor perturbations. The resulting Hubble parameter incorporates contributions from stiff matter and dark energy, the last originating from a scalar field non-minimally coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. The viability of the model is assessed by using Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and type Ia supernovae data. Best model selection based on information criteria indicates a slight preference for this new framework over the $Λ$ Cold Dark Matter model. Stability of the model follows from the positive speed of sound and absence of ``Ostrogradsky ghosts''. The total equation of state parameter hints towards the presence of a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion at $z\approx 0.66$, corresponding to the transition from matter to dark energy dominance. Early Universe dynamics, derived from the slow-roll parameters, spectral indices, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, are found to be perfectly consistent with observations from Planck 2018 and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope.

Abstract: In our previous work [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 105}. 124022 (2022)], we studied the impact of eccentricity on gravitational-wave parameter estimation for a nonspinning binary neutron star (BNS) system. We here extend the work to a more realistic case by including the spin parameter in the system. As in the previous work, we employ the analytic Fisher-Cutler-Vallisneri method to calculate the systematic bias that can be produced by using noneccentric waveforms in parameter estimation, and we verify the reliability of the method by comparing it with numerical Bayesian parameter estimation results. We generate $10^4$ BNS sources randomly distributed in the parameter space $m_1$-$m_2$-$χ_{\rm eff}$-$e_0$, where the nuetron star mass is in the range of $1 M_\odot \leq m_{1,2}\leq 2M_\odot (m_2 \leq m_1)$, the effective spin is $-0.2 \leq χ_{\rm eff} \leq0 .2$, and the eccentricity (at the reference frequency 10 Hz) is $0 \leq e_0 \leq 0.024$. For the true value of the tidal deformability ($λ$) of neutron stars, we assume the equation of state model APR4. For all gravitational-wave signals emitted from the sources, we calculate the systematic biases ($Δθ$) for the chirp mass ($M_c$), symmetric mass ratio ($η$), effective spin ($χ_{\rm eff}$), and effective tidal deformability ($\tildeλ$), and obtain generalized distributions of the biases. The distribution of biases in $M_c, η$, and $χ_{\rm eff}$ shows narrow bands that increase or decrease quadratically with increasing $e_0$, indicating a weak dependence of biases on the three parameters. On the other hand, the biases of $\tildeλ$ are widely distributed depending on the values of the mass and spin parameters at a given $e_0$. We investigate the implications of biased parameters for the inference of neutron star properties by performing Bayesian parameter estimation for specific cases.

Abstract: Vortons are of interest in high-energy physics as possible dark matter candidates and as probes of Grand Unified Theories. Using the recently derived weak-field metric for a chiral vorton, we study the dynamics of test particles by analyzing both timelike and null geodesics. We identify several classes of trajectories, including bound precessing orbits, circular orbits, toroidal, and crown-type oscillations, as well as unbound scattering paths. Poincare surfaces of section reveal transitions between regular and chaotic motions that depend sensitively on the vorton tension $Gμ$ and initial conditions. We further compute the Lense-Thirring and general spin-precession frequencies for gyroscopes along Killing trajectories. The resulting precession profiles exhibit several distinct features not present in Kerr black holes but reminiscent of Kerr naked singularities, such as: divergences near the ring core, and multi-minima structures. These dynamical and precessional signatures may offer potential observational pathways for detecting vortons.

Abstract: Binet's equation provides a direct way to obtain the geometric shape of orbits in a central force field. It is well known that in Newtonian gravitation Binet's equation leads to all the conic curves as solutions for an inverse-square force. In this work, we show how Binet's equation arises from the horizontal and vertical infinitesimal displacements of a body in free fall and in inertial motion. This derivation uses elementary concepts of infinitesimal calculus. Second, we derive the relativistic version of Binet's equation for the Schwarzschild-(anti-)de Sitter metric. This derivation, which is novel, directly relates the coordinates involved in Binet's equation without the need to introduce potentials or the use of Killing vectors. Finally, we tackle some controversies related to the role of the cosmological constant in the trajectory of photons in a Schwarzschild-(anti-)de Sitter or even in Reissner-Nordström-(anti-)de Sitter spacetimes.

Abstract: The scale-free nature of gravitational interaction in both Newtonian gravity and the general theory of relativity gives rise to the concept of self-similarity, where solutions are scale invariant. As a result of this property, the governing partial differential equations are greatly simplified and can be transformed into ordinary ones. These solutions function as attractors, characterizing the asymptotic dynamics of more general solutions. There exist situations in which self-similarity is only partially realized, giving rise to kinematic self-similar solutions. Our study provides a systematic classification of kinematic self-similar solutions corresponding to the most general spherically symmetric spacetime in the presence of bulk viscous flows.

Abstract: This paper investigates chains of rotating boson stars (BSs) within Einstein gravity coupled to a complex scalar field. The model incorporates quartic or sextic self-interactions in the scalar Lagrangian, which support the existence of stationary, solitonic, gravitationally bound solutions. We numerically construct these multi-component systems and investigate how the self-interactions alter their global properties -- specifically the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass $M$, the angular momentum $J$ and the morphology of their ergospheres. A central result is the distinct dependence of the $(ω, M)$ and $(ω, J)$ relations on the parity of the chains. Specifically, systems with an even number of constituents display spiraling curves, while those with an odd number exhibit loop structures. Moreover, we observe that two initially distinct ergospheres merge into a single one as the frequency $ω$ increases. Our analysis also indicates that the quartic interaction imposes more restrictive existence bounds, particularly for odd-numbered chains, thereby restricting stable configurations to the weak-coupling regime. In contrast, the sextic interaction has a weaker effect and enables stable solutions at substantially stronger couplings.

Abstract: Integrability structures are known to play a key role in one-dimensional scattering. In the Schwarzschild gravitational context, the analysis emphasizing the role of the so-called Darboux covariance and its intimate connection with KdV conserved quantities was recently introduced by Lenzi & Sopuerta. In a second stage, together with Jaramillo, this led in particular to the identification of the structural role of the "KdV-Virasoro-Schwarzian derivative" triangle in this problem. Such a gravitational scattering description dwells naturally on a Cauchy foliation of the spacetime. In the following, we first review--for the Schwarzschild background--this problem in a hyperboloidal foliation scheme, where the infinitesimal time generator of the dynamics is a non-selfadjoint operator. Then, we explore the underlying integrability features through a Lax-pair formulation. Specifically, the main results presented here are i) the explicit proposal of a weak Lax-pair, valid under suitable conditions involving fields at null infinity, with ii) the construction of the associated infinite sequence of isospectral flows. From a broader perspective, the very form of the non-selfadjoint infinitesimal time operator, which neatly separates into two components corresponding to bulk and boundary structures, paves the way for the description of the gravitational dynamics in terms of a "semi-direct action" of bulk degrees of freedom onto boundary degrees of freedom. This is akin to the "wave-mean flow" approach for black hole strong-gravity dynamics recently proposed in this line of research.

Abstract: We present a novel derivation of scalar cosmological perturbations in the scalar-tensor extension of non-metricity gravity, where the non-metricity scalar $Q$ is non-minimally coupled to a dynamical scalar field. While previous investigations of symmetric teleparallel gravity focused primarily on background evolution or specialised gauge choices, a complete treatment of scalar perturbations in this non-minimally coupled framework has remained unexplored. In this work, we derive the full set of perturbed field equations, impose the quasi-static approximation, and obtain the effective Poisson equation together with the corresponding modified gravitational constant $G_{\rm eff}$. These ingredients allow us to construct the density contrast evolution equation and analyse the matter growth rate and growth index. Through numerical analysis, we showed that the scalar non-metricity theory is comparable to the well-known $ΛCDM$ model to some extent. The results provide a foundation for testing scalar non-metricity theories against large-scale structure observations and open new avenues for constraining non-minimally coupled non-metricity cosmologies.

Abstract: In general relativity, the dynamics of spinning particles is governed by the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations, which are most commonly applied to massive bodies, but the framework also works in the massless case. Such massless versions naturally arise, for example, in the description of energy centroids of high-frequency wave packets. In this work, we consider massless spinning particles in spacetimes with hidden symmetries and we derive the generalized conservation laws associated with conformal Killing-Yano tensors. We then show that the spin Hall equations, a particular case of the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations restricted to massless particles with longitudinal angular momentum, are completely integrable in a large class of type D spacetimes. Additionally, we also show that for massive spinning particles, the generalized Carter constant associated with Killing-Yano tensors is conserved independently of the choice of spin supplementary condition.

Abstract: The strong interplay between Bianchi--Kantowski--Sachs (BKS) spacetimes and Thurston geometries motivates the exploration of the role of topology in our understanding of gravity. As such, we study non-tilted BKS solutions of a theory of gravity that explicitly depends on Thurston geometries. We show that shear-free solutions with perfect fluid, as well as static vacuum solutions, exist for all topologies. Moreover, we prove that, aside from non-rotationally-symmetric Bianchi II models, all BKS metrics isotropize in the presence of a positive cosmological constant, and that recollapse is never possible when the weak energy condition is satisfied. This contrasts with General Relativity (GR), where these two properties fail for Bianchi IX and KS metrics. No additional parameters compared to GR are required for these results. We discuss, in particular, how this framework might allow for simple inflationary models in any topology.

Abstract: Regular black holes offer a compelling framework to explore the consequences of resolving the central singularity of standard black holes. Using the Simpson-Visser "black-bounce" geometry as an elegant, analytically tractable framework, we explore the intricate thermodynamic behavior in such models. We demonstrate that this regular spacetime exhibits a critical instability, marked by a phase transition where the heat capacity is discontinuous. This transition signals a fundamental change in the black hole's evaporation state, which depends on the regularization parameter. Pushing beyond the semiclassical limit, we then derive the leading-order quantum corrections to the entropy via the Hamilton-Jacobi tunneling formalism. Our analysis provides a refined statistical basis for the entropy of non-singular spacetimes and offers a quantitative analysis of the nature of the black hole end-state. These results reveal that singularity resolution is not merely a geometric modification but a profound thermodynamic event, with direct implications for the stability and ultimate fate of evaporating black holes.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the cosmological implications of holographic dark energy (HDE) when the infrared cutoff is defined through the Granda-Oliveros (GO) model and the entropy-area is generalized in the context of Kaniadakis statistics. For the GO model, we showed that a spatially flat universe inevitably evolves toward a big rip singularity. At the same time, the inclusion of spatial curvature modifies the expansion rate without removing the finite-time divergence: positive curvature speeds up the formation of the singularity, whereas negative curvature induces transitions between quintessence, de Sitter, and phantom-like regimes. When Kaniadakis entropy corrections are incorporated, the qualitative behavior changes substantially. The modified HDE density admits a stable de Sitter critical point and evolves toward a little rip singularity, in which the Hubble rate diverges only at infinite cosmic time. We further demonstrate that spatial curvature acts solely as a quantitative deformation in this scenario. Although it alters the detailed expansion history, it does not alter the little-rip character of the future singularity. Our results reveal that the asymptotic fate of holographic cosmologies is highly sensitive to the underlying entropy-area relation: the GO model robustly predicts a big rip. At the same time, its Kaniadakis deformation consistently softens the singularity into a little rip, even in curved universes.

Abstract: Caustics-envelopes formed by the trajectories of fluid particles-arise in proposed dynamical extensions for shell-crossing singularities occurring in the Einstein-dust system. In this study, a local existence result is established, describing the dynamics in a neighbourhood of such caustics. Specifically, we obtain spherically symmetric spacetimes $(M,g_{μν})$ containing a caustic $\mathcal{C}$, which, in the quotient $M/SO(3)$, is a timelike curve forming a singular boundary between a 2-dust region and a vacuum region. The spacetimes are constructed from solutions to a PDE problem posed with a spacelike direction of evolution. Curvature invariants and energy densities diverge as the caustic is approached. Consequently the metric has limited regularity $g\in C^{1,1/2}$ and is shown to satisfy Einstein's equation weakly. On the complement of the caustic, the metric is smooth and satisfies Einstein's equation classically. A (degenerate) coordinate system is identified in which the dynamical variables are smooth with extension to the caustic. Finally, a novel family of static, spherically symmetric spacetimes is identified, complementing the local construction above. Each spacetime contains an eternal annular 2-dust region bounded by a pair of caustics.

Abstract: We propose a new thermodynamic inequality for stationary and asymptotically Anti-de Sitter charged and rotating black holes, $ 4πJ^2/(3MV)<1 $. This inequality is derived through an analysis of the roots of the identity which holds among the thermodynamic variables to avoid a naked singularity. We have analyzed the Kerr-AdS black hole and the asymptotically AdS uncharged and rotating black strings and find strong supporting evidence for different horizon topologies. Using this inequality we verify the validity of reverse isoperimetric inequality in its conventional form ($ {\cal R}\geq 1 $) in the presence of rotation. By examining a wide range of black hole solutions, we confirm the validity of the proposed inequality. Assuming that reverse isoperimetric inequality continues to hold in higher dimensions, and employing the intermediate refined reverse isoperimetric inequalities introduced in [\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.241401}{Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 131}, 241401}] as guiding principles, we extend the inequality to higher-dimensional spacetimes.

Abstract: We present two promising applications of training machine learning models inside a differentiable astrophysical (magneto)hydrodynamics simulator. First, we address the problem of slow convergence in hydrodynamical simulations of wind-blown bubbles with radiative cooling. We demonstrate that a learned cooling function can recover high-resolution dynamics in low-resolution simulations. Secondly, we train a convolutional neural network to correct 2D magnetohydrodynamics simulations of a specific blast wave problem. These case studies pave the way for the principled application of more general machine learning models inside astrophysical simulators.

Abstract: Rapid localisation of celestial transients like pulsars requires efficient short-timescale imaging. In radio astronomy, Fast Imaging Pipeline (FIP) addresses this need by reconstructing radio astronomical images and identifying candidates statistically. The FIP comprises imaging and localisation components but conventional radio astronomical imagers, optimised for longer integrations, limit its efficiency. To overcome this limitation, a Transient-Oriented Imager (TOI) is developed based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and parallelised on NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA. Integrating the TOI with an advanced transient detector, FITrig, forms the FIP-TOI enabling real-time and high-precision localisation of pulsar candidates. For 4K x 4K-pixel images, FIP-TOI accelerates localisation by roughly tenfold compared to a pipeline using the standard imager WSClean. Testing on diverse datasets -- including fields with multiple pulsars, an on-and-off pulsar, and a pulsar exhibiting intensity changes -- FIP-TOI demonstrates robust performance across all scenarios.

Abstract: The Bustling Universe Radio Survey Telescope in Taiwan (BURSTT) is a new-generation wide-angle radio telescope specifically designed to survey Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), energetic millisecond-duration pulses of unknown extragalactic origin. To realize its scientific potential, which includes detecting approximately 50 FRBs per year and sub-arcsecond localization capability, the system is designed to perform real-time beamforming and pulse search over the \SI{60}{\degree} $\times$ \SI{120}{\degree} field of view. This paper provides a detailed account of the design, implementation, and performance validation of the BURSTT back-end System. The system employs an efficient multi-stage processing architecture: initial beamforming is executed on the Xilinx ZCU216 RF System-on-Chip (RFSoC) platform; data is then transferred to Intel Xeon servers, where AVX-512 and AMX instruction sets are utilized for the second stage of beamforming and channelization, achieving high computational efficiency to ensure real-time capability. A highly optimized \texttt{bonsai} de-dispersion algorithm performs a real-time pulse search and triggering across 256 beams, which, upon detection, issues commands to the distributed outrigger system to save voltage data for very-long baseline interferometry (VLBI) precise localization. System performance has been validated through beamforming tests using bright radio sources and real-time detection of known pulsars, confirming the high fidelity of the signal processing pipeline.

Abstract: We search data from the GLEAM-X survey, obtained with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) in 2020, for the presence of radio frequency interference from distant Earth-orbiting satellites, in the form of unintended emissions similar to those recently seen from objects in Low Earth Orbits (LEO). Using the GLEAM-X Dec = 1.6 degree pointing, which is stationary in azimuth (on the local Meridian) and elevation (near the celestial Equator), the very wide field of view of the MWA maintains custody of a large number of satellites in geostationary and geosynchronous (GEO) orbits in this direction for long periods of time. We use one night of GLEAM-X data in the 72 - 231 MHz frequency range to form stacked images at the predicted coordinates of up to 162 such satellites, in order to search for unintended radio emission. In the majority of cases, we reach 4 sigma upper limits of better than 1 mW Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) in a 30.72 MHz bandwidth (dual polarisation), with the best limits below 10 uW. No convincing evidence for unintended emissions at these detection thresholds was found. This study builds on recent work showing an increasing prevalence of unintended emissions from satellites in LEO. Any such emission from objects in GEO could be a significant contributor to radio frequency interference experienced by the low frequency Square Kilometre Array and warrants monitoring. The current study forms a baseline for comparisons to future monitoring.

Abstract: Colliding winds in massive binaries generate X-ray-bright shocks, synchrotron radio emission, and sometimes even dusty "pinwheel" spirals. We report the first X-ray detections of the dusty WC+O binary system WR 112 from Chandra and Swift, alongside 27 years of VLA/ATCA radio monitoring and new diffraction-limited Keck images. Because we view the nearly circular orbit almost edge-on, the colliding-wind zone alternates between heavy Wolf-Rayet wind self-absorption and a near-transparent O-star wind foreground each 20-yr orbit, producing phase-locked radio and X-ray variability. This scenario leads to a prediction that the radio spectral index is flatter from a larger non-thermal contribution around the radio intensity maximum, which is indeed observed. Existing models that assume a single dust-expansion speed fail to reproduce the combined infrared geometry and radio light curve. Instead, we require an accelerating post-shock flow that climbs from near-stationary to ~1350 km/s in about one orbital cycle, naturally matching the infrared spiral from about 5" down to within 0.1", while also fitting the phase of the radio brightening. These kinematic constraints supply critical boundary conditions for future hydrodynamic simulations, which can link hot-plasma cooling, non-thermal radio emission, X-ray spectra, and dust formation in a self-consistent framework. WR 112 thus joins WR 140, WR 104, and WR 70-16 (Apep) as a benchmark system for testing colliding-wind physics under an increasingly diverse range of orbital architectures and physical conditions.

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration extragalactic transients, observationally classified as repeaters or nonrepeaters. This classification may be biased, as some apparently non-repeating sources could simply have undetected subsequent bursts. To address this, we develop a semi-supervised learning framework to identify distinguishing features of repeaters using primary observational parameters from the Blinkverse database, which draws from the CHIME/FRB Catalogs. The framework combines labeled data (known repeaters and confidently classified non-repeaters) with unlabeled sources previously flagged as non-repeaters but exhibiting repeater-like characteristics. We employ uniform manifold approximation and projection with a nearest-neighbor scheme to select potential candidates, followed by semi-supervised classification using five base estimators, including random forest, support vector machine, logistic regression, AdaBoost, and Gradient boost. Each model is fine-tuned through cross-validation, and a voting strategy among the five models is employed to enhance robustness. All models achieve consistently high performance, identifying dispersion measure, peak frequency, and fluence as the most discriminative features. Repeaters tend to show lower dispersion measures, higher peak frequencies, and higher fluences than non-repeaters. We also identify a set of candidate repeaters, several of which are consistent with prior independent studies. Our approach can identify 36 additional repeater candidates that conventional methods may have missed. Finally, the results highlight dispersion measure as a key discriminator between repeaters and non-repeaters, revealing a tension between physical and instrumental origins-either environmental effects, if the two populations arise from distinct progenitors, or detection bias, as nearby sources are more easily observed.

Abstract: A nascent magnetar, accompanying a gamma-ray burst (GRB) explosion, releases enormous rotational energy via magnetic dipole radiation. The energy loss rate of the magnetar is determined by the strength of the magnetic field at the pole. We investigated the effect of the magnetic inclination angle on the energy loss rate. The released energy is injected into the GRB jet and shapes the light curves of GRB afterglow. Different evolutionary approaches lead to different curves shapes.A shallow decay phase in GRB X-ray afterglow may result from energy injection from a magnetar with a fixed inclination angle. A two-plateau phase may result from a decreasing inclination angle scenario. In this study, we considered an increasing inclination angle scenario. The energy loss rate of the magnetar increases as the magnetic inclination angle grows. Our analysis reveals that as the lost rotational energy injected into the GRB jet increases, rebrightening phases occur in the GRB afterglows. The rebrightening features are slight and short-lived. The observed afterglow rebrightening of GRB 170822A and GRB 230414B can be well explained within our framework. Some GRB X-ray afterglows that exhibit slight and early rebrightenings may result from an increasing magnetic inclination angle of a nascent magnetar.

Abstract: The Transients and Pulsars with MeerKAT (TRAPUM) project discovered eight binary millisecond pulsars in its first shallow \textit{L}-band survey of unidentified \textit{Fermi} $γ$-ray sources using the MeerKAT radio telescope. We conducted follow-up observations using ULTRACAM on the New Technology Telescope at the La Silla Observatory to search for the optical counterpart to the pulsar companions. We found two redback companions, in PSRs J1803$-$6707 and J1036$-$4353, and provided upper limits for the other pulsar binaries. We used the \texttt{Icarus} code to fit the redback's light curves using various irradiation models. The asymmetric double-peak light curves of PSR~J1036$-$4353 are best fit with diffusion and convection models. Comparing the two prescriptions of irradiation and gravity darkening, models with post-irradiation gravity darkening provide superior fits (particularly for lower gravity-darkening exponents), suggesting that the irradiation energy is deposited deep in the stellar photosphere. PSR~J1803$-$6707, on the other hand, displayed variability in the amplitude of its irradiation-dominated light curves over a time scale of a few months. This effect can be modelled only if the companion's filling, irradiation temperature, and convection coefficients are allowed to vary over time. Had the star been closer to filling its Roche lobe, like in the cases of the known transitional millisecond pulsars J1023+0038 and J1227$-$4853, this 4.1 per~cent variation in the volume-averaged filling of the star would have caused it to experience a state change to form an active accretion disc.

Abstract: We present the first systematic study of short-timescale X-ray variability in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGN), utilizing archival Chandra observations of approximately 3,000 broad-line AGN selected from the SDSS and DESI spectroscopic surveys. We identify 14 AGN exhibiting rapid (on timescales of tens of kiloseconds) X-ray flux variations by factors of two or more that are statistically significant ($p\le6\times10^{-4}$), indicative of fast coronal variability. By converting minimum variability timescales to light-crossing times, we place upper limits on the sizes of the variable coronal regions, finding typical scales of $\lesssim10^{-4}$~pc. The coronal variable region size upper limits of an AGN in our sample are found to be much smaller than the typical coronal sizes inferred from microlensing, suggesting that its corona is composed of localized, transient structures rather than smooth, homogeneous plasmas. Such efficient magnetic energy dissipation in compact volumes is consistent with expectations for magnetically dominated coronae and is supported by recent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Future high-throughput X-ray observatories will enable the detection of even faster coronal variability, providing direct constraints on the physical mechanisms driving plasma energization and flux fluctuation near supermassive black holes. Our results suggest that luminous AGN hosting massive black holes are prime targets for probing the small-scale structure and dynamics of AGN coronae.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate synchrotron emission and the observational signatures of anisotropic non-thermal electrons during magnetic-flux eruptions in a magnetically arrested disk, using 3D GRMHD simulations. Non-thermal electrons are assumed to be energized from the thermal background through magnetic reconnection, with pitch-angle distributions modeled as beamed or loss-cone types, alongside an isotropic case for comparison. The results show that non-thermal emission can produce pronounced flux outbursts and localized brightening during eruptions, while the associated increase in optical depth can suppress the linear polarization fraction. Introducing pitch-angle anisotropy further reshapes the angular distribution of the intrinsic emissivity and modulates its contribution to various observable signatures. Our results demonstrate that anisotropic non-thermal electrons are essential for a physically complete interpretation of black hole image variability.

Abstract: We analyze DAMPE and H.E.S.S. measurements of the total cosmic-ray electron-positron spectrum, together with the AMS-02 positron fraction, using an anisotropic, spatially varying diffusion framework. The diffusion-tensor components are computed via numerical integration of test-particle trajectories in a prescribed Galactic magnetic-field model. We show that accounting simultaneously for the spatial dependence and anisotropy of the diffusion tensor yields an accurate description of the local electron and positron data up to TeV energies. The inferred injection spectral index, $Γ=-2.169$, is fully consistent with expectations from diffusive shock-acceleration theory. Within this framework, the observed spectral softening arises naturally from enhanced energy losses experienced by leptons propagating over larger distances along the regular magnetic field.

Abstract: The SS433 is a well-known binary system with an internal black hole, which is stripping mass from an orbiting companion of ten solar masses, at a hundred of light-seconds away. The black hole and its accretion disk fuel a thin precessing jet, whose spirals are well-observed. Surprisingly, disconnected gamma-ray tails have recently been discovered by H.E.S.S., HAWC and LHAASO, hundreds of light-years away and with energies of tens of TeV. We suggest that tens PeV neutron burst jets were ejected from the SS433 system over the past century. These beams of ultra high-energy PeVatron neutrons, by their in-flight beta decay and Inverse Compton scattering, could be the source of the enigmatic, distant and disconnected tens of TeV gamma-ray beams. These ultra-relativistic PeV neutron jets could have been formed during one of the system's rare and intense tidal eruptions, when tens of PeV protons collide CV October 2025 with thermal ultraviolet photons, creating delta resonances. Their decay into secondary neutron beams of tens of PeV is well consistent with observations. Alternative models appear uncompetitive.

Abstract: Recently the ARCA array detector published the down-ward-horizontal event: the KM3-230213A. It appeared as the most energetic neutrino ever observed: about 200 PeV (2 10^17 eV) up to EeV (10^18 eV) energy. This huge value, is puzzling. It is not statistically consistent with several upper bound derived by two greater and longer life detectors: by IceCube and in particular by AUGER array. Asymmetry in recent IceCube neutrino alert tracks upward and downward at same horizontal angles as ARCA one, suggest that they are mostly polluted atmospheric muon bundles. This paucity also disfavor the skimming neutrino interpretation by ARCA. We suggest that the array floating and bending in the deep sea may lead, sometime, to a misleading geometry that is pointing to a wrong arrival angle direction: a much less horizontal muon (neutrino) track respect to a much real one, more inclined and vertical, due to atmospheric muon bundle or charmed single event. Contrary to present argument, if such a rare event would be soon rediscovered in data or re-observed, it would open the road to a new guaranteed Tau neutrino Astronomy. At EeV energy such upward tau air-showers should shine AUGER telescopes or blaze future satellite in Space. A previous model in astrophysics considered energetic neutrino E>>100 EeV, neutrino scattering, onto cosmic, relic, light mass ones. Their ultra-relativistic Z boson resonance formation and its decay in flight would produce hadron UHECR relics around tens-hundred EeV energy. Explaining how sources located at far distances, above the usual GZK hundred Mpc, cut off ones, may shine and cluster in AUGER or TA data.

Abstract: The quantitative impact of strong rotation on the amplitudes and frequencies of the post-bounce gravitational wave (GW) signal from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is still not fully understood. To study trends in frequencies and amplitudes, and possibly spectacular phenomena like resonant amplification, we perform a series of axisymmetric long-duration magnetohydrodynamic CCSN simulations of a 17 $M_\odot$ progenitor using a finely spaced grid in initial rotation rate from 0.29 rad/s to 3.48 rad/s. We find that these rotating models produce GWs at frequencies of up to 3 kHz, higher than in typical non-rotating models in the literature. The high frequencies arise due to small polar radii of rapidly rotating proto-neutron stars and stabilization by angular momentum gradients at lower latitude. GW frequencies and amplitudes tend to decrease with faster rotation. Different from two complementary simulations without magnetic fields, the magnetohydrodynamic models are characterized by an absence of p-modes above the dominant high-frequency emission band. We find no indication of resonant mode amplification for any rotation rate, although a temporo-spatial and space-frequency analysis reveals some interesting couplings of quadrupolar motions across the proto-neutron star and the gain region. We find that linear mode analysis based on the spherically averaged structure becomes unsuitable in this regime of rapid rotation. More advanced perturbative techniques need to be developed to study the mode structure and mode interaction in the collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars.

Abstract: We systematically investigate the fundamental oscillation frequencies of dark matter admixed neutron stars, focusing on models with self-interacting fermionic dark matter that couples to normal matter solely through gravity. The analysis is carried out within a two-fluid formalism under the relativistic Cowling approximation, where the perturbation equations follow from the linearized energy-momentum conservation laws of both components. We find that the mass-scaled fundamental frequencies of the nuclear (dark) fluid in dark core (halo) configurations exhibit a remarkably tight correlation with the total stellar compactness. This universality persists across the dark matter parameter space explored in this study and is largely insensitive to the choice of nuclear equation of state. In contrast, we also find the breakdown of such universality with the tidal deformability, i.e, the same frequencies show substantial deviations from universality when expressed in terms of the tidal deformability. These contrasting behaviors highlight possible observational imprints of dark matter in neutron star interiors.

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are intense pulses with unknown origins. A subclass of repeating FRBs show some common features, such as associated compact persistent radio sources (PRSs), high burst rates, and large host-galaxy dispersion measures (DMs). Meanwhile, they show diverse DM and rotation measure (RM) variations, which cannot be explained by current models. A unified model urgently needs to be established. Here we show the first evidence for a supernova remnant surrounding the FRB 20190520B source. We then demonstrate that the five active repeating FRB sources associated with PRSs can be understood within a single model in which central objects are young magnetars in massive binary systems embedded in supernova remnants. This model naturally predicts distinct variations of DM and RM for repeating FRBs. Crucially, young magnetar wind nebulae can generate bright PRSs. As a magnetar becomes older, the luminosity of a PRS will fade, which can naturally explain less-luminous PRSs for some active FRBs. Our results support a unified population of active FRBs in dynamic magnetized environments.

Abstract: We investigate binary mergers of galaxy clusters and the resulting radio relics using three-dimensional simulations. The initial setup consists of two idealized, spherical subclusters with a mass ratio below three, each permeated by turbulent magnetic fields, and we follow their mergers with a high-order accurate magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code. In parallel, we track the acceleration of cosmic-ray electrons (CRe) via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) at merger-driven shocks, together with radiative cooling and Fermi-II (turbulent) acceleration in the postshock region, employing a high-order Fokker-Planck solver. Synchrotron emission is computed from the simulated CRe distribution and magnetic fields. In this paper, we detail these numerical approaches and present the first results obtained with them. Two prominent axial shocks emerge along the merger axis; the shock ahead of the heavier subcluster systematically attains a higher Mach number, although it is more compact, than that ahead of the lighter subcluster. Turbulent magnetic fields--both inherited from the initial condition and amplified during the merger--produce patchy, fine-scale structures in the radio surface brightness. Because of the combined effects of turbulent acceleration, spatially nonuniform magnetic fields, and the curved geometry of merger shocks, the volume-integrated radio spectra show deviations from the canonical power-law steepening expected for a planar shock with a uniform field. Reacceleration of preexisting fossil CRe enhances the surface brightness. Our results highlight the coupled roles of merger dynamics, MHD turbulence, and CRe physics in shaping up the observed properties of radio relics in cluster outskirts.

Abstract: EP241217a is an X-ray transient detected by the Einstein Probe (EP) lasting for about 100 seconds and without accompanying $γ$-ray detection. The optical spectroscopy reveals the redshift of EP241217a is 4.59. By combining the $γ$-ray upper limit provided by GECAM-C, there is a considerable possibility that EP241217a is a typical Type II gamma-ray burst (GRB), but it is fainter than the detection threshold of any available $γ$-ray monitors (i.e., $E_{γ,{\rm iso}}\lesssim10^{53}$ erg). The X-ray light curve exhibits a plateau lasting for $\sim5\times10^4$ seconds. However, the joint analysis with optical data suggests the presence of an achromatic bump peaking at $\sim3\times10^4$ s after the trigger, indicating the actual duration of the X-ray plateau may be significantly shorter than it appears. To interpret the achromatic bump, we adopt the scenario of a mildly relativistic jet coasting in a wind-like medium and encountering a rapid density enhancement of the circumburst medium, which is likely induced by the the interaction of the progenitor's stellar wind and the interstellar medium. However, this model cannot fully explain observed data, and some issues do exist, e.g., the observed spectrum is harder than the model prediction. Consequently, we conclude that the scenario of a mildly relativistic jet coasting in the wind-like medium cannot explain all observed features of EP241217a. In addition, some alternative models commonly invoked to explain X-ray plateaus are discussed, but there are more or less issues when they are applied to EP241217a. Therefore, further theoretical modeling is encouraged to explore the origin of EP241217a.

Abstract: Interstellar magnetic field is essential in various astrophysical phenomena and processes. Pulsar halos are a recently discovered class of TeV gamma-ray sources formed by escaping electrons/positrons from pulsars. The morphology of the halo is regulated by the diffusion of those escaping particles, and hence carries information of the interstellar magnetic field. We suggest that the morphology of TeV pulsar halos can be used as a novel probe of the properties of interstellar magnetic field around the pulsar, such as the Alfvénic Mach number and the mean direction. We establish a theoretical relation between these quantities and the observational features of the halo's morphology based on the anisotropic diffusion model, and show how X-ray observations of the pulsar halos can further improve the diagnosis of the magnetic field.

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a unique probe of the early Universe. Their cosmological evolution is governed by the competition between mass accretion and Hawking evaporation. In this paper we look into the details impact of accretion. Most of the earlier analysis relied on non-relativistic accretion models. In this work, we reinvestigate this in a fully relativistic framework for Kerr PBHs in the radiation-dominated era. We derive relativistic accretion rate and compute spin-dependent efficiency $λ_{\text{Kerr}}(a_*)$. Using this result, we construct coupled evolution equations for the PBH mass and spin that include both relativistic accretion and spin-dependent evaporation. Our analysis shows that relativistic accretion significantly increases PBH masses and consequently suppresses their spins, causing all PBHs to become effectively Schwarzschild well before evaporation. These effects strengthen the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound on the initial PBH mass by a factor of $\sim 4$--$5$, reduce the mass required for survival to the present epoch to $\sim 2.7\times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{g}$, and shift the viable particle like DM parameter space. Notably the early accretion induced spin-down effect further washes out the well known high-frequency, spin-induced feature in the high frequency stochastic gravitational-wave background, modifying predictions for future detectors.

Abstract: It has been suggested that spinning wormholes may mimic Kerr black holes in astronomical sources such as X-ray binaries and supermassive compact objects in centers of galaxies. With recent advances in instrumentation this could be tested if clear differences between wormhole and black hole accretion were identified. We aim to quantitatively determine the extent to which the orbital properties of test particles in the gravity of a spinning wormhole may differ from those of a Kerr black hole. We seek to find an observable related to disk accretion that would be clearly different for Kerr black holes and Kerr-like wormholes. We use the standard Lagrangian approach to derive the orbital properties of test particles from an effective potential. We use standard thin disk theory to infer the disk surface temperature. We find that at a given circumferential radius the physical quantities relating to circular orbits in the equatorial plane are exactly the same for the spinning wormhole and a black hole of the same mass and angular momentum, if only the two space-time metrics differ in the g_rr component alone. However, for a wormhole there are no orbits of radius less than that of its throat. Non-circular orbits, bound or unbound, are affected by the radial distance function; in particular, the angle of apsidal precession in Kerr-like wormholes will differ from that in Kerr black holes. A Kerr-like wormhole is a perfect black hole mimicker in relation to the orbital properties in the equatorial plane. The angular velocity, specific energy, specific angular momentum, and Lense-Thirring precession rate are the same for a Kerr black hole and a Kerr-like wormhole in circular orbits of the same circumference. We find that the area of the (geometrically thin) accretion disk is different, and this yields a visibly suppressed disk temperature for traversable wormholes with a sufficiently wide throat.

Abstract: We investigate the prospects of observing residual eccentricity in a population of compact binaries by calculating the power in the eccentric harmonics, following the methodology in arXiv:2411.04187. Although most observed compact binary coalescences are expected to circularize before entering the sensitivity band of the ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, dynamical interactions in dense star clusters can lead to a fraction of these binaries with non-negligible eccentricity at the time of detection. To quantify the observability of eccentricity, we simulate a population of merging compact binaries and identify those which have sufficient power in sub-dominant eccentric harmonics to be clearly distinguishable from quasi-circular systems. We consider a binary black hole (BBH) population derived from globular cluster simulations with residual eccentricity distribution obtained from Cluster Monte Carlo (CMC) catalogs as well as a fiducial log-uniform model. Assuming the LIGO-Virgo network of GW detectors with their sensitivities achieved during LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Observing Run (O4), we find that the BBH population with measurable eccentricity will have a significantly higher median eccentricity $e_{\mathrm{10Hz}}\sim 0.3$ (with $90\%$ range: $0.1 - 0.5$) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $\sim 20$ ($90\%$ range: $13 - 57$) compared to the observable population of BBHs. We compare our predictions of the regions of parameter space where eccentricity is detectable with the claimed observations of eccentricity in GW events from third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3).

Abstract: The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) has revealed numerous ultrahigh-energy gamma-ray sources of unknown origin. We propose that a fraction of them can be explained by microquasar remnants, i.e., binary systems where mass transfer has ceased and the central engine is quenched. Cosmic rays injected during the active phase of a microquasar may remain confined within its cocoon and subsequently interact with nearby molecular clouds, producing bright gamma-ray emission through $pp$ collisions. Remnants of former super-Eddington systems can act as dark PeVatrons, releasing particles up to $\sim$10 PeV that illuminate surrounding clouds producing gamma rays reaching hundreds of TeV. This scenario provides a natural explanation for several unidentified Galactic LHAASO sources.
