Yet, when computing cosmological observables, they are often treated as classical stochastic fields. Do they nevertheless retain quantum birthmarks? A hallmark of genuinely quantum behaviour is quantum interferences, arising from phase coherence between distinct branches of the wavefunction. Such interference is diagnosed by the non-positivity of the Wigner function, and according to Hudson's theorem, the only pure states with positive Wigner functions are Gaussian states. Consequently, any departure from Gaussianity necessarily implies a non-positive Wigner function, precluding a description in terms of a classical distribution. This motivates us to compute the Wigner function of curvature perturbations, accounting for primordial non-Gaussianities, using the EFT of inflation. We find that the Wigner function develops pronounced interference fringes on super-Hubble scales, and in particular, its negativity grows as $a^2$ in ultra-slow-roll backgrounds. These results demonstrate that quantum effects can remain significant at late times, and that squeezing alone does not ensure classicality, contrary to standard lore. This suggests that the prospects for detecting genuinely quantum signatures of the universe's origins in cosmological observables may be less bleak than previously thought."}

We consider three representative $f(T)$ parametrisations that recover the teleparallel equivalent of General Relativity at early times and deviate from it only at late epochs. The models are confronted with unanchored Pantheon+ Type~Ia supernovae, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations, compressed Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, and redshift-space distortion data, allowing us to jointly probe the background expansion and the growth of cosmic structures. Two of the three models partially shift the inferred value of $H_0$ towards local measurements, while the third worsens the discrepancy. This behaviour is directly linked to the effective torsional dynamics, with phantom-like regimes favouring higher $H_0$ and quintessence-like regimes producing the opposite effect. A global statistical comparison shows that the minimal $f(T)$ extensions considered here are not favoured over $Λ$CDM by the combined data. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that late-time torsional modifications can non-trivially redistribute current cosmological tensions among the background and growth sectors."}

It is generally assumed that the observation of a black hole with subsolar mass $M_{\\rm obs}$ would provide strong evidence for primordial black holes (PBHs). The mass $M_{\\rm PBH}$ of the PBH, however, does not necessarily have to be equal to $M_{\\rm obs}$, as it would in what we term a ``direct PBH scenario\". Instead, a black hole of mass $M_{\\rm obs}$ may form in a capture of a much smaller primordial black hole, $M_{\\rm PBH} \\ll M_{\\rm obs}$, by a dwarf star of mass $M_* \\simeq M_{\\rm obs}$, followed by the total consumption of the star by the PBH. We provide some rough estimates and demonstrate that such an ``indirect PBH scenario\" may also lead to significant populations of black holes with mass $M_{\\rm obs}$, especially in dwarf galaxies, and may be able to explain rare subsolar mass events."}

Key results/observations summarized in Table 1, which refers readers to the relevant sections for different comparisons. Submitted to the Open Journal of Astrophysics. Comments welcome", "summary": "X-ray luminous cool-core (CC) galaxy clusters contain powerful cosmic ray (CR) sources. High-energy CRs powering GHz synchrotron lose energy rapidly, but long-lived (~Gyr-old) populations of 0.1-1 GeV CRs persist, propagating to ~100 kpc distances and radiating via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons. We explore observable consequences of such CR-IC emission. This produces remarkably thermal X-ray spectra, which could contribute significantly to emission in CC centers. These naturally connect to ultra-steep radio sources and radio mini-halos at younger ages, but become undetectable in most radio, hard-X-ray, and $γ$-ray searches (though future imaging may detect them), while reproducing apparent density, temperature, entropy, and mass deposition rates of CCs. This would provide an alternative resolution of the cooling flow problem: clusters may appear as strong CCs because of strong CR-IC, while not actually cooling so rapidly. This predicts many observed correlations between AGN/jet properties, radio galaxy and minihalo properties, cooling radii, cavity radii and apparent X-ray cooling luminosity $L_{\\rm X,cool}$. Since $L_{\\rm X,cool}$ is actually from CR-IC, the observed radio-X-ray ($L_{\\rm radio}-L_{\\rm X,cool}$), apparent cavity power ($P_{\\rm cav}-L_{\\rm X,cool}-L_{\\rm radio}$), and strong CC-AGN correlations are predicted without free parameters. Since CR-IC leads to X-ray overestimates of thermal pressure, the ratio of SZ to X-ray pressures should drop in CC centers. CR-IC also suppresses abundances inferred from X-ray relative to optical/UV measurements in CC centers. Both of these appear to be seen in sufficiently-resolved CCs. Effects on cluster cosmology, hydrostatic mass estimation, and non-thermal pressure/turbulence estimators are small. Redshift evolution of CC surface brightness profiles could provide strong constraints or imply CR-IC at high-$z$."}

Assuming isothermal intracluster gas, the hydrostatic masses are $\\log(M_{500}/M_\\odot)=14.76$ for PSZ-E and 14.54 for PSZ-W, implying a mass ratio of $\\sim 1:1.7$.

Both subclusters exhibit ICM asymmetries consistent with ram-pressure stripping, and PSZ-W displays an X-ray tail extending nearly to the outskirts of PSZ-E. The orientation and length of this tail support an off-axis merger geometry. Thermodynamic maps reveal a hot ($\\sim 7.3$ keV), high-pressure, high-entropy bridge between the cores. From the Rankine-Hugoniot temperature jump, we infer a Mach number $M=1.41^{+0.33}_{-0.30}$, consistent with a weak merger shock propagating at $1620^{+500}_{-420}$ km s$^{-1}$. These results indicate a merger with a non-zero impact parameter, likely observed near core passage ($\\lesssim 0.5$ Gyr before or after), with the pre-pericenter scenario slightly preferred based on the projected separation and thermodynamic structure."}

Realistic noisy counterparts synthesized from these bases using our noise model enable the construction of abundant paired datasets for supervised learning.

Using post-Newtonian relations between the mass M (including the binding energy) and angular momentum J of quasi-circular, nonspinning binaries, we uncover a puzzling result: When the binary's instantaneous M and J are mapped to those of a hypothetical Kerr black hole, the corresponding entropy exhibits a maximum during the evolution. This maximum occurs at values of M and J strikingly close to those of the final remnant predicted by numerical relativity. Consistent behavior is observed when using the relation between M and J obtained from numerical relativity evolution. Although this procedure is somewhat ad hoc, the agreement between the masses and spins of the final state obtained from numerical relativity and the results of this maximum entropy procedure is remarkable, with agreement to within a few percent when using either post-Newtonian or numerical relativity results for M and J. These findings allow us to propose an entropy maximization conjecture for binary black hole mergers, hinting that thermodynamic principles may govern the selection of the final black hole state."}

In particular, we consider populations of ordinary supernovae (SNe), super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe), and luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) with a newly formed magnetar as the central engine. We discuss both the thermal electromagnetic and non-thermal neutrino emission from such sources. We scan the parameter space of the dipolar magnetic field strength and the initial spin period to determine characteristic optical emission properties and lightcurve timescales of these transients. Additionally, our scan identifies which classes of these transients can reproduce the required diffuse flux level and neutrino energies. Combining our results, we conclude that a diffuse neutrino flux from a population of LFBOTs can explain the KM3NeT event. Therefore, pulsar-powered optical transients may serve as promising sources for the current and upcoming high-energy and ultra-high energy neutrino telescopes."}

We demonstrate for the first time that, contrary to earlier claims, ultraspinning black holes can admit thermodynamically stable regions, whose existence crucially depends on the spacetime dimension, the solution branch, and the presence of charge. In addition, we present the first application of the revised reverse isoperimetric inequality to ultraspinning black holes. Despite the violation of the original reverse isoperimetric inequality in this super-entropic regime, we find that the revised inequality remains applicable and imposes nontrivial constraints on the allowed parameter space, including an upper bound on the ultraspinning parameter $μ$, strengthened lower bounds on the mass $m$, and upper bounds on both the charge $q$ and the AdS radius $l$. To ensure the consistency of the thermodynamic description, the conserved charges and the first law in the ultraspinning limit are derived using the Iyer-Wald formalism together with integrability conditions."}

Notably, early results showed significant complexity to the Fe-K$α$ line profile in AGN, with clear contributions from at least three emitting structures: an inner disc, intermediary broad line region (BLR) scale material, and an outer torus. This poses a new challenge for the modelling of the emission lines, as while fast sophisticated models exist for disc line-profiles, large scale-height material is typically much more complex. In this paper we aim to address this gap, by building a fully analytic model for the emission line profiles from a wind, aimed towards BLR scale material, motivated on previous reverberation studies suggesting a wind on the inner edge of the BLR. Our approach gives a physically motivated, yet computationally fast, model for the intermediary component to the Fe-K$α$ complex seen in the XRISM data. We demonstrate our model on the XRISM observations of NGC 4151 from the performance verification phase, showing that it gives a good description of the data, with physically reasonable parameters for BLR scale material. We also show that our model naturally gives the smooth line profile seen in the data, due to the large spatial extent of a wind. Finally, we make our model code public to the community, and name it xwind."}

We identify all ultraviolet divergent structures within these nonlocal terms and provide a consistent renormalization procedure. To analyze the physical impact of these terms, we apply a local approximation under the assumption of slowly-varying fields, by which the memory term acts as a negative contribution to the drift coefficient. As a concrete application, we consider a massive $φ^4$ theory and show that these one-loop corrections lead to a suppression of the field variance in the infrared regime compared to the tree-level results."}

The black hole is characterized by the ( MOG) parameter (α) and the charge (Q). The study finds that as (α) increases, the event horizon radius (r_h), photon sphere radius (r_{ph}), and critical impact parameter (b_{ph}) all increase, while these decrease as (Q) increases. The innermost stable circular orbit radius (r_{isco}) exhibits similar monotonic behavior. Ray-tracing shows that as (Q) increases, the impact parameter (b) interval between the lensing ring and photon ring widens; (b_{\\text{ph}}) is non-degenerate, and the photon ring radius is uniquely determined by (α) and (Q). Using $EHT$ constraints on (SgrA^*) and (M87^*), the bounds on (α) and (Q) are derived. For (Q = 0), (0.5), and (1), the allowed ranges are (α\\in [0, 0.06]), ([0, 0.11]), and ([0.19, 0.36]), respectively. Radiative simulations show that for fixed (Q), larger (α) leads to a larger, non-degenerate photon ring. The Schwarzschild case is approached only when both (α) and (Q) are small. This provides a computational basis for testing modified black holes and offers a non-degenerate observational criterion for distinguishing quantum gravity models, consistent with current $EHT$ data. Future observations with $ngEHT$ and multi-band polarization can further test this. The results suggest that studying the photon ring structure of a Reissner-Nordström black hole in scalar-tensor-vector gravity provides a unique optical diagnostic for potential quantum-gravity tests and black hole properties."}

However, classical accretion theory applicable to such hot accretion flows treats spherically symmetric Bondi accretion and disc-like advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) as two distinct limiting cases, lacking a unified framework for flows with finite angular momentum. In this work, we develop such a framework that continuously connects these two regimes. Our model naturally recovers the Bondi solution in the limit of vanishing angular momentum and approaches the properties of classical ADAFs at high angular momentum, while providing a physically well-defined description of the intermediate regime where neither limiting case is strictly applicable. We further demonstrate that the accretion rate is jointly regulated by the angular momentum of the ambient gas and the gas viscosity. For sufficiently large but physically reasonable viscosity, the accretion rate can remain at a significant fraction of the Bondi rate even in the presence of substantial gas rotation. These results offer a natural explanation for how such accretion rates can be sustained despite finite angular momentum in realistic galactic environments."}

While its universal manifestation is a net change of proper distances, gravitational-wave detectors are intrinsically insensitive to the final offset and can only probe the associated transition. A central challenge for any claim of detection therefore lies in defining a physically meaningful and operationally robust model of this time-dependent signal, which is uniquely attributable to gravitational memory and distinguishable from purely oscillatory radiation. In this work, we propose a general solution to this challenge. Building on a self-contained review of the theory of gravitational memory, we discuss a theoretical framework for defining and modeling a gravitational memory rise, in particular applicable to compact binary coalescences. Specializing to space-based detectors, we analyze the response of LISA to gravitational radiation including a memory contribution, with particular emphasis on mergers of supermassive black hole binaries, which offer the most promising prospects for a first single-event detection. The framework developed here provides the theoretical foundation for statistically well-defined hypothesis testing between memory-free and memory-full radiation and quantitative assessments of detection prospects. As such, these results establish a principled pathway toward a future observational claim of gravitational memory."}

In this work, we explore the ability of LISA to observe and characterize this effect. In order to do this, we use state-of-the-art simulations of the LISA instrument, and we perform a Bayesian analysis to assess the detectability and establish general conditions to claim detection of the displacement memory effect from individual massive black hole binary (MBHB) merger events in LISA. We perform parameter estimation both to explore the impact of the displacement memory effect and to reconstruct its amplitude. We discuss the precision at which such a reconstruction can be obtained thus opening the way to tests of GR and alternative theories.

They can be observed by recently developed multi-wavelength facilities. In this paper, we calculate emissions across multi-wavelengths associated with XFs and EEs under the hypothesis that XFs and EEs are optically-thin synchrotron emissions from nonthermal electrons in relativistic jets. Considering ranges of the dissipation radius $r_{\\rm diss}$ and the Lorentz factor $Γ$ of the jet, we determine the parameter space in which a detectable emission can be produced at each wavelength. We found that simultaneous ultraviolet and very-high-energy gamma-ray emission associated with XFs or EEs can be detected by Swift/UVOT, SVOM/VT, and CTAO approximately every three years. The detection and non-detection rates for each detector are key to determining the uncertain yet essential values necessary for understanding the physics of GRB jets."}

We consider a Fishbone--Moncrief torus orbiting a Kerr black hole with spin parameter $a = 0.9375$, threaded by large-scale magnetic fields that are asymmetric about the equatorial plane. The degree of equatorial asymmetry in the magnetic field is parametrized by an angle, with values of $30^\\circ$, $45^\\circ$, and $60^\\circ$. We examine how this equatorially asymmetric initial magnetic field configuration influences the magnetic field structure, accretion flow morphology, and angular momentum transport across a range of initial plasma beta values ($β= 0.007, 0.005, 0.001$). We find that such deformation in the magnetic field leads to noticeable changes in the inner disk structure, asymmetric outflow patterns in the poloidal plane, and time-dependent variations in accretion rates. These effects are generally more pronounced at lower beta values, where magnetic pressure dominates; in particular, the $30^\\circ$ case at $β= 0.001$ exhibits strong and persistent asymmetric inflows and outflows. Our results demonstrate that equatorially asymmetric magnetic field configurations can significantly influence the structure and variability of relativistic accretion flows.

NGC 4278, a local LLAGN, has recently been identified as a VHE source following detections by LHAASO. In this study, we present a multi-wavelength and multi-messenger analysis to investigate the physical origin of this emission. Swift-XRT monitoring reveals a quasi-quiescent state characterized by a low X-ray flux. Modeling the broadband spectral energy distribution with the leptohadronic code AMES, we find that a standard one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model underpredicts the VHE flux by $\\sim$70% due to the insufficient target photon density provided by the weak X-ray emission, unless a high Doppler factor ($δ\\gtrsim 5$) is invoked. Alternatively, an external inverse-Compton (EIC) scenario-scattering seed photons from a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF)-successfully reproduces the broadband spectral energy distribution with a modest jet power and Doppler factor. We further explore the neutrino production within a leptohadronic framework. The predicted muon neutrino event rate is highest in the EIC quiescent model, reaching $N_{ν_μ} \\sim 0.001$ for a 15-year IceCube observation (assuming 0.1% of the Eddington luminosity is partitioned into high-energy protons). Future multi-messenger observations are essential to unveil the details of the high-energy processes of NGC 4278."}

Using post-Newtonian relations between the mass M (including the binding energy) and angular momentum J of quasi-circular, nonspinning binaries, we uncover a puzzling result: When the binary's instantaneous M and J are mapped to those of a hypothetical Kerr black hole, the corresponding entropy exhibits a maximum during the evolution. This maximum occurs at values of M and J strikingly close to those of the final remnant predicted by numerical relativity. Consistent behavior is observed when using the relation between M and J obtained from numerical relativity evolution. Although this procedure is somewhat ad hoc, the agreement between the masses and spins of the final state obtained from numerical relativity and the results of this maximum entropy procedure is remarkable, with agreement to within a few percent when using either post-Newtonian or numerical relativity results for M and J. These findings allow us to propose an entropy maximization conjecture for binary black hole mergers, hinting that thermodynamic principles may govern the selection of the final black hole state."}
