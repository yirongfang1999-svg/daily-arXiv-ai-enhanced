Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are sources of gravitational waves (GWs) produced by hydrodynamical instabilities and highly time-dependent anisotropies of the neutrino radiation. In this work we analyze both contributions to the GW signal for two state-of-the-art three-dimensional (3D) SN models computed with the Prometheus-Vertex neutrino-hydrodynamics code. In contrast to the far majority of models analyzed for GWs so far, our core-collapse simulations were started with 12.28 M_sun (18.88 M_sun) progenitors, whose final hour (7 min) of convective oxygen-shell burning was computed in 3D and featured a vigorous oxygen-neon shell merger. The corresponding large-scale asymmetries in the oxygen layer are conducive to buoyancy-aided neutrino-driven explosions. The models were continuously evolved in 3D from the pre-collapse evolution until 5.11 s (1.68 s) after the core bounce. The GW signals result from the well-known dynamical phenomena in the SN core such as prompt postshock convection, neutrino-driven convection, the standing accretion shock instability, proto-neutron star oscillations, and anisotropic ejecta expansion. They do not exhibit any new or specific features that can be unambiguously connected to the powerful pre-collapse activity in the progenitors, but we identify interesting differences compared to results in the literature. We also discuss measurement prospects by interferometers, confirming that GW signals from future Galactic SNe will be detectable with existing and next-generation experiments working in the frequency range f ~ 1-2000 Hz.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We construct a charged Bardeen black hole (BH) surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) and coupled to a cloud of strings (CS). The metric function combines the magnetic monopole charge from nonlinear electrodynamics, the PFDM logarithmic correction, and the CS parameter that renders the spacetime asymptotically non-flat. We analyze the horizon structure, identifying parameter ranges yielding non-extremal BHs, extremal configurations, and naked singularities. The null geodesics, photon sphere radius, and shadow are computed, revealing that both CS and PFDM enlarge the shadow. For neutral particle dynamics, we derive the specific energy, angular momentum, and innermost stable circular orbit location. Quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) are examined through the azimuthal, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies, where notably the azimuthal frequency is independent of the CS parameter. Scalar field perturbations governed by the Klein-Gordon equation yield an effective potential whose peak decreases with both parameters, yet the transmission and reflection probabilities respond oppositely to CS and PFDM variations. The greybody factor bounds are obtained using semi-analytical methods. Our results demonstrate that the distinct effects of $α$ and $β$ on various observables could allow independent constraints on these parameters through shadow measurements, QPO timing, and gravitational wave ringdown observations.

Abstract: In the present work we examine the MTS, for the restriction to spherical dust plus $Λ$, proving that it actually is a characteristic surface of the Cauchy problem (generated by its characteristic curves), which opens the possibility for infinite solutions. This translate as the MTS being a boundary between arbitrarily independent solutions, reminiscent of the Birkhoff theorem effects. This property is illustrated with combinations of 3 examples containing MTSs and $Λ$ ($Λ$CDM, Schwarzschild-de\,Sitter, Lemaître-Tolman-Bondi-de\,Sitter: LTBdS -- i.e. the inhomogeneous, spherically symmetric $Λ$CDM). The LTBdS model presents a static, stable MTS for the first time.

Abstract: This letter proposes a new avenue for understanding the cosmological singularity. The standard cosmological model contains a generic initial singularity usually referred to as the {\em big bang}. Herein, we present a novel idea to extend the description of our Universe beyond this limit. The proposal relies on rewriting physics in a purely Riemannian, {\em i.e.} locally Euclidean, 4-dimensional space and the emergence of Lorentzian patches owing to the interaction of all matter fields to a clock field that is responsible for a signature change. If our universe is contained within one of these patches, the initial singularity is replaced by a smooth boundary on which the signature of the physical metric flips. In this letter, we first define the model and draw the necessary conditions on its arbitrary functions for solutions to exist. Next, we prove the existence of solutions that lead to an emergent universe with a primordial (almost) de Sitter phase. To finish, we discuss the consequences of this construction for the universe on scales much larger than our observable universe: a large ``Euclidean sea'' in which Lorentzian islands locally emerge and host an expanding universe potentially similar to ours. While speculative, this scenario has specific features that can be tested, and the present letter sets the basis for further phenomenological investigations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Within the framework of scalar-tensor theories of gravity, certain models can evade classical black hole no-hair theorems. A well-known example is Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, where black holes carrying a scalar charge can exist. We find that, within this theory, binary black holes initially described by General Relativity can acquire scalar charges once they reach a critical orbital separation ("dynamical scalarization"). We develop a simple semi-analytic model, based on the adiabatic conservation of the total Wald entropy, to estimate the scalar charge evolution during the binary inspiral. We also run fully nonlinear numerical-relativity simulations for different configurations, finding consistent results. The gravitational-wave phase difference between Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet and General Relativity waveforms, which we use to assess detectability, is also computed. We find that dynamical scalarization might be observable in nearly equal-mass binary black hole mergers with third-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, in a narrow range of the dimensional coupling of the theory.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: If a strong first-order phase transition takes place at sufficiently high rest-mass densities in the equation of state (EOS) modelling compact stars, a new branch will appear in the mass-radius sequence of stable equilibria. This branch will be populated by stars comprising a quark-matter core and a hadronic-matter envelope, i.e., hybrid stars, which represent ``twin-star'' solutions to equilibria having the same mass but a fully hadronic EOS. While both branches are stable to linear perturbations, it is unclear which of the twin solutions is the ``favoured'' one, that is, which of the two configurations is expected to be found in nature. We assess this point by performing a large campaign of general-relativistic simulations aimed at assessing the response of compact stars on the two branches to perturbations of various strength. In this way, we find that, independently of whether the stars populate the hadronic or the twin branch, their response is characterised by a critical-perturbation strength such that the star will oscillate on the original branch for subcritical perturbations and migrate to the neighbouring branch for supercritical perturbations while conserving rest-mass. Because the critical values are different for stars with the same rest-mass but sitting on either branch, it is possible to define as favoured the part of the branch that has the largest critical perturbation, thus correcting the common wisdom that stellar models on the twin branch are the favoured ones. Interestingly, we show that the binding energies on the two branches can be used to deduce without simulations which of the stellar configurations is more likely to be found in nature.

Abstract: A recent paper proposes a static ellipsoidal space-time metric that reduces to Schwarzschild. After examining the corrected line element using Maple's Differential geometry package, we find that the Einstein tendor and Ricci scalar are non-zero, and the metric yields non-zero pressures when interpreted as an anisotropic fluid. Thus, it does not represent a vacuum solution. We also checked a cited ellipsoidal metric from the literature and found it likewise fails to satisfy the vacuum Einstein equations.

Abstract: For specifically coupled values of the quadratic gravity parameters, we present a fully explicit static spherically symmetric solution. It contains the central singularity surrounded by the black-hole or the cosmological horizon for the negative or positive cosmological parameter, respectively. This spacetime, thus, belongs to the already analyzed classes of solutions expressed in terms of the Frobenius expansions, continuous fractions, or numerical simulations; however, it has not been explicitly identified before. The purpose of the presented highly-constrained somehow unphysical model is to reveal a global geometric picture that may occur in spherical spacetimes within quadratic gravity, which is typically hidden in more general approximative solutions. At the same time, it can serve as a solid benchmark for evaluating the accuracy of the methods employed to obtain such solutions.

Abstract: Following the numerous evidence for large-scale cosmic isotropy violation with the advent of the `precision cosmology' era, we explore the possible advantages of extending the flat $Λ$CDM model to more general models in order to constrain anisotropies in the universe, otherwise absent in the standard model based on FLRW spacetime. Such extensions are offered by the topologically unique Thurston geometries, which are homogeneous but anisotropic spacetime models. In this work, we attempt to distinguish Thurston geometries from one another by introducing anisotropies via different scale factors in different directions, thereby introducing additional model parameters such as shear, eccentricity, curvature, and a preferred axis. We used the latest compilation of Pantheon+ \& SH0ES Type Ia supernova data for deriving model constraints, and found mild evidence of large-scale isotropy violation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Regular black holes are often used to address singularities, but they typically involve a potentially unstable de Sitter core and an internal horizon that breaks predictability. Integrable singularities (IS) have recently gained attention because they avoid both issues and exhibit finite tidal forces, allowing nondestructive radial infall. First, we present a new BH solution sourced by a string fluid (FS) that exhibits an IS. Motivated by the divergence of the conserved energy in the cloud of strings (CS) model, we introduce an energy density profile based on the screening of the CS energy density within an FS framework, yielding a finite conserved energy. On the other hand, it has been proposed \cite{Ovalle:2024wtv} that an interior region, rather than a pointlike mass, can generate a Schwarzschild BH exterior region. Secondly, motivated by the variety of BH solutions with singularities in the literature, we establish the conditions that an interior region with an IS must satisfy to represent a generic exterior BH solution, with Schwarzschild being only a particular case of the latter. We derive the junction conditions (JC) between the interior and exterior regions, showing that they lead to temperature continuity at the interface, while discontinuities in tangential pressure lead to phase transitions. We propose that the nature of the interior region is described by CS and FS, while the exterior corresponds to Reissner Nordström.

Abstract: The recently reported precession period of about $11.24$ years of the M87* jet provides a sensitive probe of strong field gravity and the electromagnetic environment in the immediate vicinity of supermassive black holes. In this work, we study the precession of the spherical orbit in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson geometry describing a rotating black hole immersed in a uniform electromagnetic field. Although the timelike geodesics is non-separable, we develop a Hamiltonian approach to investigate the spherical orbits. For sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the study shows that the spherical orbits can only exist within a finite radial range for given orbital inclination. Requiring the existence of the spherical orbits, we obtain an upper bound of the magnetic field, i.e., $B<0.33 M^{-1}$ for prograde and $B<0.0165 M^{-1}$ for retrograde motion. Furthermore, imposing the observed jet precession period, we obtain a significantly tighter constraint, $B\lesssim 0.0145 M^{-1}$, providing a new constrain on the magnetic field of M87* independent of the shadow. Our results provide unified constraints on the parameters of the KBR black hole and demonstrate that the jet precession offers a robust and complementary probe of magnetized black holes in the strong gravity regime.

Abstract: The proper-time method for constructing perturbative dynamical gravitational fields is presented. Using the proper-time method, a perturbative analytical model of gravitational waves against the backdrop of an exact wave solution of Einstein's equations in a Bianchi IV universe is constructed. To construct the perturbative analytical wave model a privileged wave coordinate system and a synchronous time function associated with the proper time of an observer freely moving in a gravitational wave were used. Reduction of the field equations, taking into account compatibility conditions, reduces the mathematical model of gravitational waves to a system of coupled ordinary differential equations for functions of the wave variable. Analytical solutions for the components of the gravitational-wave metric have been found. The stability of the resulting perturbative solutions is proven. The stability of the exact solution for a gravitational wave in the anisotropic Bianchi IV universe is demonstrated.

Abstract: External non-minimally coupled scalar and spinor field perturbations have been studied in a (1 + 1) dimensional dilatonic blackhole spacetime [1, 2]. Exact analytical expressions of the quasi- normal mode frequencies have been found for both the cases. In the scalar perturbations the quasi-normal mode frequencies turn out to be purely imaginary and negative. Furthermore we have found that the quasi-normal frequencies for Dirac field exhibit both real and imaginary part. The QNM frequencies decay monotonically with the overtone number under certain class of the blackhole parameters. The decay profile ensures the stability of the blackhole spacetime under these perturbations.

Abstract: Dehnen $(1,4,\frac32)$ dark matter halo has been proven to be a valuable model for describing the surface brightness distributions of elliptical galaxies, yet its implications for black hole spacetimes remain largely unexplored. In this work, we construct a novel exact black hole solution embedded in this Dehnen halo and investigate its physical consequences. The influence of the halo on black hole thermodynamics is analyzed through the mass function, entropy, Hawking temperature, heat capacity, and Gibbs free energy, allowing us to assess both local and global thermodynamic stability of the black hole-dark matter system. Our results show that the presence of a Dehnen-type halo not only stabilizes the otherwise thermodynamically unstable Schwarzschild black hole but also induces phase transitions. In addition, we study null geodesics to examine photon motion, the shadow radius and the optical appearance of the system. The dark matter halo modifies the effective potential, leading to observable changes in the photon sphere and the apparent size of the shadow. We also explore the instability of circular null geodesics and its relation to quasinormal modes in an eikonal limit. These findings highlight the significant role of realistic dark matter distributions in shaping both the thermodynamic behavior and the observable signatures of black holes, providing further insight into the interplay between dark matter halos and central black holes in galaxies.

Abstract: By studying first a new decelerating sudden future singularity (SFS) universe we report finding a novel type of cosmological singularity which we dub a finite time pseudo-rip (FTPR) because unlike for a pseudo-rip, it happens in the finite future of the universe. In contrast to the new SFS model, where the expansion is decelerating before reaching the pressure singularity, the FTPR scenario is preceded by a super-accelerated phantom phase. Our claim is based on the thorough study of the energy conditions showing the violations of all of them for a FTPR, and only the dominant energy one for an SFS. Application of the so-called Raychaudhuri averaging shows that, alike within the requirement of geodesic completeness, these singularities are weak in the sense of this definition. We study the properties of the models including the behaviour of the cosmological horizons presented in the appropriate Penrose diagrams.

Abstract: Gowdy cosmologies are exact, spatially inhomogeneous solutions of the vacuum Einstein equations which describe nonlinear gravitational waves coalescing at the Big Bang singularity. With toroidal spatial sections they provenly have the Asymptotic Velocity Domination property, in that close to the Big Bang dynamical spatial gradients fade out and the dynamics is governed by a Carroll-type gravity theory. Here we construct an infinite set of Dirac observables for Gowdy cosmologies, valid off-shell, strongly, and without gauge fixing. These observables stay regular at the Big Bang and can be matched to much simpler Dirac observables of the Carroll-type gravity theory. Conversely, in an adapted foliation there is a systematic anti-Newtonian expansion (in inverse powers of the reduced Newton constant) of the full Dirac observables whose leading terms are the Carroll ones. In particular, this provides an off-shell generalization of the Asymptotic Velocity Domination property.

Abstract: The Electromagnetically Isolated Global Signal Estimation Platform (EIGSEP) is a new instrument designed to measure the global 21-cm signal from Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization, redshifted to frequencies below 250 MHz. To reduce spectral structure in the antenna beam associated with ground scattering, EIGSEP uses a shaped bowtie antenna suspended in a canyon 100 m above the ground. We describe the current system design of EIGSEP, including the rotating antenna platform, a transmitter antenna to characterise the beam of the bowtie antenna, and auxiliary ground antennas. We then discuss the EIGSEP calibration scheme, which incorporates traditional Dicke switching in the receiver, and novel approaches that include beam mapping, beam modulation, and interferometric cross-correlation. The instrument has been deployed near Marjum Pass, Utah, for testing and initial data collection. We discuss the site characteristics and present initial field measurements.

Abstract: We present SQUIDPOL, a low-cost, multi-channel optical imaging polarimeter that performs simultaneous linear polarization measurements using a rotating half-wave plate, a non-polarizing beam splitter, and four wire-grid filters. We show that the off-the-shelf non-polarizing beam splitter introduces measurable polarization-dependent systematics, which can bias polarimetric measurements if left uncorrected. We quantify this effect for both transmitted and reflected beams and incorporate a correction scheme into the data-analysis pipeline. On-sky validation demonstrates stable and reproducible performance, achieving a polarization accuracy of about 0.15 percent for bright polarized standard stars. Mounted on the 60-cm Ritchey-Chretien telescope (focal length 4200 mm, f/7) at the Pyeongchang Observatory of Seoul National University, SQUIDPOL provides an effective common field of view of 13.5 by 8.2 arcminutes with a pixel scale of 0.45 arcseconds per pixel and supports standard B, V, R_C, and I_C filters.

Abstract: The dynamics of the inner regions of young stellar objects (YSOs) is driven by a variety of physical phenomena, from magnetospheres and accretion to the dust sublimation rim and inner disk flows. These inner environments evolve on timescales of hours to days, exactly when bursts, dips, and rapid structural changes carry the most valuable information about star and planet formations, but remain hardly reachable with current facilities. A better reactive infrastructure with six or more telescopes, combined with alerts from large time-domain surveys (e.g., at the era of LSST/Rubin type facilities), and equipped with instruments spanning from the V-band to the thermal infrared (N), would provide the instantaneous uv-coverage and spectral diagnostics needed to unambiguously interpret and image these events as they happen. Such a world's first time-domain interferometric observatory would enable qualitatively new science: directly linking optical and infrared variability to spatially resolved changes in magnetospheric accretion, inner-disk geometry, and dust and gas dynamics in the innermost astronomical unit. Crucially, connecting these processes to outer-scale unresolved information from JWST, ALMA, and the ELT would yield a complete tomography of the planet-forming region.

Abstract: The Euclid spacecraft, located at the second Lagrangian point of the Sun-Earth system, hosts the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) instrument. NISP is equipped with a mosaic of 16 HgCdTe-based detectors to acquire near-infrared photometric and spectroscopic data. To meet the spacecraft's constraints on computational resources and telemetry bandwidth, the near-infrared signal is processed onboard via a dedicated hardware-software architecture designed to fulfil the stringent Euclid's data-quality requirements. A custom application software, running on the two NISP data processing units, implements the NISP signal estimator: an ad-hoc algorithm which delivers accurate flux measurements and simultaneously estimates the quality of signal estimation through the quality factor parameter. This paper investigates the properties of the NISP signal estimator by evaluating its performance during the early flight operations of the NISP instrument. First, we revisit the assumptions on which the inference of the near-infrared signal is based and investigate the origin of the main systematics of the signal estimator through Monte Carlo simulations. Then, we test the flight performance of the NISP signal estimator. Results indicate a systematic bias lower than 0.01 e/s for 99% of the NISP pixel array, well within the noise budget of the estimated signal. We also derive an analytical expression for the variance of the NISP signal estimator, demonstrating its validity, particularly when the covariance matrix is not pre-computed. Finally, we provide a robust statistical framework to interpret the QF parameter, analyse its dependence on the signal estimator bias, and show its sensitivity to cosmic ray hits on NISP detectors. Our findings corroborate previous results on the NISP signal estimator and suggest a leading-order correction based on the agreement between flight data and simulations.

Abstract: Thermal radiation transport is a challenging problem in computational physics that has long been approached primarily in one of a few standard ways: approximate moment methods (for instance P$_1$ or M$_1$), implicit Monte Carlo, discrete ordinates, and long characteristics. In this work we consider the efficacy of the Method of (Long) Characteristics (MOC) applied to thermal radiation transport. Along the way we develop three major ideas: transporting MOC particles backwards in time from quadrature grids at the end of the timestep, limiting the computational cost of these backward characteristics by terminating transport once optical depths along rays become sufficiently large, and timestep-dependent closures with multigroup MOC solutions for a gray low-order system. We apply this method to a suite of standard radiation transport and radiation hydrodynamics test problems. We compare the method to several standard analytic and semi-analytic solutions, as well as implicit Monte Carlo, P$_1$, and discrete ordinates (S$_n$). We see that the method: gives excellent agreement with known results, has stability for large time steps, has the diffusion limit for large spatial cells, and achieves $\sim$20-70\% performance improvement when terminating optical depths at O(10-100) in the grey Marshak and crooked pipe problems. However, for the Coax radiation-hydrodynamics problem, we see that MOC is approximately two to three times slower than IMC-DDMC and S$_n$ in its current implementation.

Abstract: Two-photon polymerization (2PP) enables fabrication of high-precision micro-optics with complex freeform geometries, opening a new parameter space for custom astronomical optics. Among available resins, the newly developed IPX Clear is particularly well suited for visible applications, offering high transmission across the visible-near-IR, low surface roughness, and excellent shape fidelity. However, Fresnel reflections at the air-polymer interface introduce significant optical losses, which are detrimental in low-signal astronomy. Previous studies show grass-like alumina coatings on glass and fused silica can raise average transmission from 91.9% to approximately 99% over 400-900 nm. Here we explore the feasibility of Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) to apply such coatings to IPX-Clear micro-optics over 400-1700 nm. Grass-like alumina anti-reflective (AR) coatings can approximate the ideal index condition by creating a gradual refractive-index transition from air to bulk IPX Clear, suppressing surface reflections. While grass-like coatings are established on bulk optics and conformal ALD films have been applied to 2PP micro-optics, we demonstrate - for the first time - alumina grass on 2PP microlenses made with the new IPX-Clear resin. We discuss key challenges and process steps, and observe that alumina-grass-coated microlenses lose only approximately 0.3% of photons to reflection in the 400-850 nm range. Future work will test performance across the full 400-1700 nm band and explore improved environmental resilience, e.g., a SiO2 overcoat. Combined with the high optical transparency of IPX Clear, these coatings enable custom-designed, highly efficient microlenses for astronomical applications.
