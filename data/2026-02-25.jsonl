Our high-resolution image discovers new small-scale features in the nebula, including an elliptical core of $40''\\times20''$ surrounding the central pulsar and a $2'$-long arc wrapping around the core in the north. The latter shows a clear gap from the core, and it consists of a bright lobe in the northwest and a tongue-like structure in the northeast. These could be resulting from the pulsar wind interaction with the environment. Our polarization measurement reveals a highly ordered magnetic field with toroidal geometry. The small scale features are all highly linearly polarized. In particular, the lobe has a polarization fraction of $\\sim$60%, close to the synchrotron limit. This is also much higher than the value measured at a lower frequency, implying significant depolarization. We show that this can be explained by Faraday rotation in the nebula, and we constructed a simple 3D model accordingly to infer a magnetic field strength of $\\sim$50-105$μ$G."}

The origin of these isolated objects therefore remains an open problem. In this Letter, we propose a physically motivated encounter rate per binary, $Λ\\propto n a/(σa_H)$, incorporating the local stellar density $n$, velocity dispersion $σ$, binary separation $a$, and the Heggie--Hills ionization radius $a_H$. Combined with companion ablation by the MSP, this rate successfully predicts the observed fraction of isolated MSPs in GCs, that is $\\mathcal{F}_i \\proptoΛ\\propto a_H^{-1}$, establishing dynamical ionization as the primary channel for producing isolated MSPs. We quantitatively test this model against a null hypothesis in which $\\mathcal{F}_i$ is independent of $a_H$, and find that the ionization-driven model is 220 times more likely than the null hypothesis. Our framework naturally explains the observed overabundance of isolated MSPs in $ω$ Centauri and establishes binary ionization as the primary mechanism responsible for the production of isolated MSPs in GCs."}

This, in turn, could mean that the dark matter halo also shares these properties. In this work, by fitting to the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray observations, we test the compatibility of the morphology of the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) from dark matter annihilation with a triaxial dark matter halo. In particular, we consider both untilted triaxial halos and halos whose principal axes are tilted with respect to the Galactic disk. In our fits of the Fermi-LAT data, by testing over a large library of galactic diffuse emission models, we quantify how the halo triaxiality and tilt affect the line-of-sight-integrated annihilation signal and, consequently, the preferred GCE spatial templates. We find that the GCE spectrum and inner cuspiness are robust against variations in the triaxiality and tilt of the dark matter halo. However, in terms of its overall morphology, the GCE in the gamma-ray data can discriminate between choices for the dark matter halo's triaxiality and tilt. Finally, we find that the GCE is more compatible with originating from a triaxial and tilted halo of dark matter than originating from a triaxial and tilted halo of stars, a result important for understanding the GCE's origin."}

Such fluids can be often described by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In this review, we mainly consider MHD turbulence with a strong mean magnetic field whose energy density is greater than or equal to the local kinetic energy density. In these fluids, the MHD waves, especially Alfvén waves, play a dominant dynamical role. Alfvén waves travel along magnetic field lines and collisions of opposite-traveling Alfvén wave packets are essential for turbulence cascade. We focus on strong turbulence regime, where nonlinear interaction during the collision is sufficiently strong and thus one collision is enough to complete turbulence cascade. We will cover the following types of turbulence. First, we review strong Alfvénic MHD turbulence. If the mean magnetic field is very strong, wave packets move very fast and duration of collision is too short to complete turbulence cascade. Even in this case we will show that strong turbulence regime emerges on a small scale. Second, we will consider small-scale MHD turbulence, where interaction of small-scale variants of Alfvén waves (i.e., whistler waves) is important. Third, we review scaling relations in strong relativistic force-free MHD turbulence, where interaction of relativistic Alfvén waves is important. Finally, we briefly discuss scaling relations in compressible MHD turbulence, where interaction of Alfvén waves is still important."}

Bayesian statistics offers a natural remedy, letting us update our knowledge of physical models as new data arrive, without re-analyzing existing data. However, doing so requires the posterior probability density of model parameters for previous observations, which is typically intractable. Here, we use variational neural posterior estimation to rapidly update the inferred population of binary black holes as data are observed in gravitational-wave detectors. We apply this approach to real and simulated catalogs analyzed with both low- and high-dimensional population models, testing the reliability of three update cadences: with new catalogs of sources, month by month during an observing run, and as each new signal arrives. We investigate the success and failure modes of neural sequential updates, finding that the robustness of updating is sensitive to the information contained in each update and that updating is most effective when performed with larger segments of data. We outline one additional scientific application enabled by Bayesian updating: identification of events that are individually informative about the population. Neural Bayesian updates to astrophysical population models also provide efficient likelihood representations for joint analyses with other data, e.g., standard-siren cosmology, and similar methods can be used to perform Bayesian stochastic background searches."}

Geometry-only and geometry+morphology methods provide modest gains over the reconstruction baseline, and contrastive variants do not show stable improvement. Likelihood scoring on AE latents is consistently stronger: across three seeds, latent-only likelihood reaches ROC-AUC $0.8555\\pm 0.0181$ and PR-AUC $0.9219 \\pm 0.0118$, versus ROC-AUC $0.7663 \\pm 0.0450$ and PR-AUC $0.8667 \\pm 0.0255$ for AE+manifold.

Prior work has advanced HOWFSC algorithms and profiled candidate implementations on radiation-hardened processors, highlighting a substantial gap between the computational demands of LUVOIR-scale HOWFSC and the capabilities of current onboard spacecraft hardware. In this paper, we argue that this gap can be closed by offloading the HOWFSC pipeline to a dedicated co-flying compute satellite at Sun-Earth L2. This approach enables the use of modern, radiation-tolerant high-performance processors without increasing risk to the primary observatory. We show that such an architecture can increase the end-to-end control cadence from the sub-hertz regime typical of radiation-hardened onboard processing or ground-in-the-loop operation to tens and even hundreds of hertz. We evaluate commercial hardware platforms in terms of performance and feasibility, and we propose custom architectures that enable higher control frequencies with significant power consumption reductions.

We employ a toy model to describe the oscillatory dynamics and its coupling to the field modes, focusing on the resulting effects in the exterior spacetime of the star. The Bogoliubov coefficients relating the in and out vacua are computed non-perturbatively using high-precision numerical methods, without relying on weak-field, small-amplitude or small-velocity expansions. This allows us to determine the full particle spectrum and the total particle number in the strong-field and fully relativistic regime.

Although discovered in this context, there is no evidence that the transient is associated with any known gravitational wave event. Nonetheless, this source exhibits a 20-fold increase in flux density over $<250$ days, and it remains in a declining, detectable state more than 1000 days after the initial detection. Follow-up observations from 0.3 to 9 GHz reveal an evolving spectrum consistent with synchrotron emission. ASKAP J0055-2558 is spatially coincident with a low-mass, star-forming galaxy at redshift $z = 0.116$ ($d_{\\rm L}$= 543 Mpc), placing its peak radio luminosity at $νL_ν\\sim 10^{39}\\,\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}$. Analysis of its radio light curve, inferred blastwave velocity, energetics, host galaxy properties and the absence of counterparts at other wavelengths suggest that ASKAP J0055-2558 is most consistent with either the late-time phase of an orphan long gamma-ray burst afterglow or a tidal disruption event involving an intermediate-mass black hole spatially offset from the galaxy nucleus. The radio discovery of either of these phenomena is extremely rare, with only a few or no confirmed examples to date."}

However, we confirm that no single potential consistently captures all relativistic effects. In particular, while certain parameters yield agreement with general relativity for planetary motion and redshift, they fail to reproduce gravitational lensing over a broad range of impact parameters. Our results highlight both the usefulness and limitations of pseudo-Newtonian methods in modeling gravitational phenomena. Although the pseudo-Newtonian approach cannot serve as universal substitutes for general relativity, especially in strong-field regimes, it provides valuable semi-analytical insight and pedagogical simplicity.

Compact jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN) are commonly assumed to be in equipartition between particle and magnetic-field energy densities at the regions where the radio emission dominates at centimetre wavelengths. This assumption has significant implications for both jet physics and the accuracy of VLBI-based astrometry and geodesy.\n  Aims. We tested the validity of the energy equipartition hypothesis in AGN cores at centimetre wavelengths by analysing the blazar 1803+784 using simultaneous broadband full-polarization observations with the VLBI Global Observing System (VGOS).\n  Methods. We present VGOS observations of the blazar 1803+784 covering the 3-11 GHz frequency range. The data were processed using a dedicated calibration pipeline, followed by model fitting and multi-frequency imaging analysis. We measured the frequency-dependent core shift and mapped the spectral index and rotation measure (RM) across the source.\n  Results. We find a core-shift power-law index of $k_r = 0.73^{+0.12}_{-0.19}$, significantly deviating from the expected equipartition value of $k_r = 1$. This indicates that either the equipartition condition or the conical jet geometry, or both, are not fulfilled in the centimetre-wavelength core region. The wide frequency coverage of VGOS also allows us to decouple the Faraday rotation of the core into an internal component (${\\rm RM}_I = 121 \\pm 8$ rad m$^{-2}$, produced in the core region) and an external component (${\\rm RM}_E = -44 \\pm 9$ rad m$^{-2}$, associated with a distant, extended medium that may also affect the polarization in downstream regions of the jet at larger scales).\n  Conclusions. These results demonstrate the power of VGOS for high-fidelity simultaneous multi-frequency polarimetric studies of compact AGN jets, and underline the need to account for non-equipartition effects in both jet astrophysics and geodetic VLBI."}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "An accurate model of the point spread function is required in order to estimate positions and brightnesses of stars in digitized images. The PSF of the Gaia space telescope is unusual due to the use of drift-scan mode and time-delayed integration, in which the satellite spins and precesses while images are captured. This induces several systematic and periodic distortions in the PSF that are unique to Gaia. These include systematic variations in the stellar image drift rate with respect to the charge transfer rate, and spatial variations in the CCD response that are, contrary to expectations, not marginalised by the use of TDI mode. These must be incorporated into the PSF model in order to reduce systematic errors in Gaia's data products.\n  We have developed a semi-analytic model of the PSF, in which the blurring effects of along- and across-scan stellar image motion are modelled analytically, and dependences of the PSF shape on source colour and position within the CCD are calibrated empirically. Constraints on the PSF origin are introduced in order to break a degeneracy with the geometric instrument calibration. Our new PSF model leads to significant improvements in the modelling of observations, particularly around the 11-13 magnitude range in G. This will contribute to reductions in the astrometric and photometric uncertainties in the derived data products. Our PSF model was deployed in the Gaia cyclic data processing systems and used in the production of the forthcoming Data Release 4. The linear part of Gaia's PSF is now well understood. Future development work will focus on the handling of several nonlinear effects that depend on the signal level, including charge transfer inefficiency and the brighter-fatter effect. This work will provide a useful reference for users of Gaia data and for other missions that use the same observing principles, such as the proposed GaiaNIR mission."}

The motivation is to enable realistic accretion disk studies in MGR, where full relativistic MHD simulations remain computationally prohibitive. Effective potentials and the underlying Newtonian-like forces are derived for both massive and massless particles in the equatorial plane, relevant for disk dynamics. The reliability of the PNP is tested by comparing key orbital properties -- marginally stable, marginally bound, photon orbits and energies at marginally stable orbit radii -- with exact MGR predictions. The PNP reproduces the marginally stable and photon orbits exactly, while marginally bound orbits and specific energies deviate by less than about 7-10%. The influence of the MGR parameter on particle dynamics and effective potentials is analyzed, revealing non-trivial departures from simple Newtonian intuition. The study demonstrates that the proposed PNP accurately captures essential spatial properties of MGR spacetime and provides an efficient, physically consistent tool for investigating accretion phenomena and strong-gravity astrophysics beyond general relativity."}

As part of Transients and Pulsars with MeerKAT (TRAPUM), we conducted a survey of Fermi-LAT sources using the Ultra High Frequency (UHF; 544-1088 MHz) receiver of the MeerKAT radio telescope. We observed 79 sources that were identified as pulsar-like candidates using a random forest technique from the Fermi-LAT Fourth Source Catalogue. We observed each target for 10 minutes at two separate epochs. As a result, we discovered nine new millisecond pulsars (MSPs) and six slow pulsars. Based on the radio discoveries, we also searched for gamma-ray pulsations, confirming that seven of the newly discovered MSPs are associated with Fermi-LAT sources, and performed joint radio and gamma-ray pulsar timing. Companion mass estimates and evidence of radio eclipses indicate that among the nine MSPs there are three black widows and three redbacks. Lastly, we compared the discovered pulsars in the MeerKAT UHF survey against the previous Fermi sources TRAPUM survey at L band, concluding the superiority of UHF observations in sensitivity to fainter pulsars and in detection rate than L band for finding new gamma-ray MSPs."}

Here we investigate a novel quantum probe of strong-field gravity: the gravitomagnetic Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect for Cooper pairs propagating in Kerr spacetime. The frame-dragging induced by a rotating black hole (BH) generates an effective vector potential through the off-diagonal metric component $g_{tφ}$, which couples to the macroscopic phase of the superconducting condensate. We derive the gauge-invariant AB phase shift $Δθ= (4πm^* Ma/\\hbar)(1/r_2 - 1/r_1)$ for an interferometer with arms at radii $r_1$ and $r_2$, where $m^* = 2m_e$ is the Cooper pair mass and $a$ is the BH spin parameter.

A TeV halo around Geminga is detected by HAWC, and the measurements of its surface brightness profile indicate a slow particle diffusion surrounding the source. This result challenges the pulsar interpretation of the positron excess. The observations at GeV energies provide direct information on the electron/positron density in the GeV nebula, which can offer more direct constraints on the origin of the positron excess. Two previous works have performed analyses on the GeV emission of the pulsar halo, but focused on the energy band above 8 GeV. In this work, we use a longer dataset from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) to re-analyze the GeV halo emission of Geminga, extending the analysis to cover the energy range of 1-1000 GeV. We find that the analysis in this wider energy range results in a low significance of the halo emission. This can be attributed to the Galactic interstellar emission model being unable to perfectly fit the background over this broader energy range, and due to the low measured halo flux at $<$ 10 GeV energies leading to a mismatch between the observation and model expectation. We also derive the spectral energy distribution of the tentative halo emission, which shows a very hard spectrum in the 1-10 GeV range."}

We tested the validity of the energy equipartition hypothesis in AGN cores at centimetre wavelengths by analysing the blazar 1803+784 using simultaneous broadband full-polarization observations with the VLBI Global Observing System (VGOS).\n  Methods. We present VGOS observations of the blazar 1803+784 covering the 3-11 GHz frequency range. The data were processed using a dedicated calibration pipeline, followed by model fitting and multi-frequency imaging analysis. We measured the frequency-dependent core shift and mapped the spectral index and rotation measure (RM) across the source.\n  Results. We find a core-shift power-law index of $k_r = 0.73^{+0.12}_{-0.19}$, significantly deviating from the expected equipartition value of $k_r = 1$.

The Fishbone-Moncrief torus is well established for this purpose in numerical astrophysics. The extent of the magnetic vector potential inside the torus that we coin the filling factor has not been studied before in the case of MAD simulations. We employ five 3D general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations initialized with large-scale tori, that are immersed in weak, poloidal magnetic fields. To study the impact of the spatial extent of the initial magnetic field, hence the magnetic energy content in the torus, we scale it with the filling factor w.r.t. the poloidal geometric area of the mass density distribution. A common choice of the filling factor is complimented and investigated in terms of altered energetics and angular momentum transport. Further, we investigate the polarized, radiative imprints of synchrotron emission on M87 at 86 GHz, comparing them with VLBI observations. Our simulations show that elevated filling factors significantly increase the electromagnetic energy contributions and outward angular momentum transport in the jet, due to the initially increased magnetic energy-content in the torus. High magnetic fillings exhibit increased linear polarization fractions, agreeing with the observed 15$\\%$ in M87*. We find the jet morphology more prone to disk-vertical flux tubes generated by MAD events. We show, that GRMHD simulations bracket the jet width measurements at the jet base in M87*. Increased magnetic filling of the torus produces jets that are noticeably brighter downstream compared to our reference models, hence, we find high fillings well suited for extended GRMHD jet models of other low-luminosity AGN, as well."}

The real part of the potential controls the cosmological background and realizes a plateau-type inflation compatible with $α$-attractor $\\mathrm{T}$-models, while the imaginary part acts as an effective non-Hermitian deformation encoding dissipative effects. Working in the Jordan frame and imposing ghost-free conditions on the effective Planck mass, we derive the background equations and define a complex equation-of-state parameter whose real part governs the expansion and whose imaginary part quantifies departures from conservative dynamics. Numerical integration shows that the duration of inflation is primarily controlled by the nonminimal coupling $ζ$, whereas the complex asymmetry parameter $Δ\\varepsilon$ has a negligible impact on the real background: the real energy density and pressure vary by less than $10^{-5}$ as $Δ\\varepsilon$ is scanned over its allowed range.

In the 6.5-6.9 keV band, XRISM reveals multiple Fe XXV and Fe XXVI emission components. One is a broad (with a width of sigma = 3000 km/s) and redshifted (+3400 km/s) component, originating at D = 0.02 pc from the central black hole. The other two components are narrow (with a width of sigma = 500 km/s) and exhibit redshifted and blueshifted velocities (+2600 km/s and -1500 km/s), originating from more distant regions (D = 0.1 pc). The photo-ionized model explains the broader component, while the two narrower components can be explained by either photo-ionization or collisional ionization. One interpretation is that the broader component is an outflow at ~10^2 R_S (R_S; Schwarzschild radius) and the narrow component is a shock-heated plasma close to the torus, with a possible connection to the JWST-discovered outflow outside the torus. Two blueshifted absorption lines are detected at ~7.1 keV (~10^4 km/s) and ~10.6 keV (~10^5 km/s). The line significance of the 10.6 keV line is above 98%. The absorption line components might be attributed to the broad emission component. These results demonstrate the high potential of XRISM/Resolve to characterize ionized emission and absorption features in the Fe-K band.

Working within a local Rindler-wedge framework, we formulate the Clausius relation as the stationarity condition of a Massieu functional at fixed Unruh temperature, which identifies the entropy slope as the parameter controlling the effective gravitational coupling. For area-type entropies with constant slope, the construction reproduces Einstein's equations with $G_{eff} = 1/(4s_0)$, while curvature-dependent entropy densities supplemented by an internal entropy-production term yield the field equations of $f(R)$ gravity.\n  Motivated by group-entropic considerations and long-range correlations, we model the entropy of horizon cross sections by a power law $S(A) = η(A/4G)^δ$ and analyze its local and global implications. To fix the otherwise arbitrary coarse-graining scale entering the entropy slope, we introduce a Topological Calibration Principle that ties the reference area to intrinsic geometric data through the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. For compact two-dimensional sections, this selects a canonical calibration area and leads to a topology-dependent effective coupling $G_{eff}(χ) \\propto |χ|^{1-δ}$ where $χ$ represents the Euler characteristic. Consistency across scales and topologies yields logarithmic bounds on $|1-δ|$, while the associated scale dependence induces a characteristic modulation of the gravitational coupling in cosmology.

The superradiant condition is obtained explicitly and we demonstrate that energy extraction occurs exclusively for co-rotating modes satisfying $Ω< m Ω_H$.

Based on this, there are attempts to explain the diffuse neutrinos observed by IceCube with the accumulated contribution from a population of AGNs, but it is found that the maximum neutrino energy is less than tens of TeV and, as a result, additional source classes are needed to explain the high-energy component above this energy. Recently, motivated by the detection of >100 TeV neutrinos from the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469, it was shown that the turbulence acceleration in the corona can explain >100 TeV neutrinos given a larger magnetization parameter ($σ\\sim 1$) in the corona, which leads to a larger maximum proton energy and a hard proton spectrum. In this paper, we extend this assumption to the population of AGNs and study whether the population of AGNs with a wide range of magnetization can explain the entire diffuse neutrinos. We find that AGN coronae could account for the diffuse neutrinos up to PeV energies if a significant fraction of AGNs have magnetization as large as $σ\\sim 1-10$. This conclusion is insensitive to the shape of the magnetization parameter distribution as long as the range of the magnetization parameter is sufficiently wide and the distribution is flat towards high magnetization. Interestingly, this model can also explain the peak of the diffuse neutrino spectrum at 30 TeV."}

Our model-independent analysis for 42 transient sources shows that statistically NSXBs do not prefer to show a canonical high soft state as observed in BHXBs. Additionally, the probability distribution of the duration of the 2-20 keV X-ray outburst is observed to peak at a significantly longer duration ($>$100 days) for BHXBs than for NSXBs (15-60 days). Our analysis shows that among candidate sources, Swift J1728.9-3613, MAXI J1535-571, MAXI J1659-152, EXO 1846-031 show a `q' diagram in the HID and prefer to align with the HID frequency distribution of BHXBs that show `q' diagram, MAXI J1305-704 and MAXI J1836-194 align with frequency distribution of black hole sources without `q' diagram while MAXI J1848-015 shows the HID distribution similar to NSXBs, indicating a neutron star accretor. Therefore, a long-term statistical study of MAXI and Swift/BAT X-ray outbursts from a large sample of transient sources may be used to distinguish BHXB from NSXB."}

In this paper, our aim is to utilize the observations of M87* to preliminarily constrain the parameters of the rotating black hole in Bumblebee gravity by modeling the motion of the tilted accretion disk particle with the spherical orbits. We compute spherical orbits and ISSOs, demonstrating that the conserved quantities energy $\\mathcal{E}$, angular momentum $\\mathcal{L}$, and Carter constan $\\mathcal{K}$ depend on $(r,a,\\ell,ζ)$, exhibiting distinct behaviors for prograde and retrograde orbits. For prograde orbits, the ISSO radius $r_{ISSO}$ decreases with spin parameter $a$ and LSB parameter $\\ell$ and increases with the tilt angular $ζ$, whereas the opposite trends occur for retrograde orbits. Angular analysis shows that $θ$ oscillates within $(π/2-ζ, π/2+ζ)$, while $φ$ increases approximately linearly, enabling the determination of the oscillation period $T_θ$, azimuthal accumulation $φ(T_θ)/π$, and precession angular velocity $ω_t$. Using the observed jet precession period $T=11.24 \\pm 0.47$ years with a fixed tilt $ζ=1.25^\\circ$, the warp radius $r/M$ ranges from $(5.73,25.15)$ for prograde and $(6.16,26.46)$ for retrograde orbits, increasing with $a$ or $\\ell$. Comparisons with Kerr limits ($r/M=14.12$ prograde, $16.1$ retrograde) suggest that $r/M>16$ may indicate a non-vacuum Bumblebee vector field. Incorporating the EHT shadow $θ_{sh}=42\\pm3μ$as further constrains $r/M$ to $(5.82,22.61)$ and $(6.17,24.74)$, with discrepancies of $0.05\\sim1.96$."}

The keyhole has a morphology similar to that of many jet-shaped pairs of bubbles in cooling-flow clusters of galaxies and planetary nebulae. Therefore, the findings of this study, which make the bipolar structure of SN 1987A robust, strengthen the claim that a pair of energetic jets shaped the keyhole and its surroundings. According to the jittering-jets explosion mechanism (JJEM), this pair of jets was the most energetic of several pairs that exploded SN 1987A. This study adds to the accumulating evidence that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe, responsible for the majority, or even all, CCSNe."}

Halo matter not only removes the central singularity but also modifies the quasinormal spectrum. We show that the resulting quasinormal spectrum deviates systematically from the Schwarzschild case, with shifts in both oscillation frequencies and damping rates that grow with the halo scale parameter and the Einasto index. In near-extremal configurations, the damping rate can be significantly suppressed, leading to long-lived modes. The effects of regularity and environmental factors on the spectrum are found to be substantially larger than the estimated numerical uncertainty, as confirmed independently by high-order WKB calculations with Padé resummation and time-domain integration."}

An analytical model of the general relativistic gravitomagnetic Lense-Thirring precession of the effective orbit of a fictitious test particle revolving about a spinning primary can explain the observed precessional features. It yields allowed regions in the system's parameter space which, as far as the hole's dimensionless spin parameter is concerned, are essentially in agreement with those obtained in the literature with general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. The present analytical approach can be extended to include the precession due to the hole's quadrupole mass moment as well. It breaks the degeneracy in the allowed regions occurring for negative and positive values of the spin parameter when only the Lense-Thirring effect is considered. The best estimate for the hole's mass yields the range $0.185-0.215$ for the dimensionless spin parameter. Using the same strategy with the gravitomagnetic frequency for an extended disk of finite size with a parameterized power-law mass density yields to distinct, generally non-overlapping allowed regions for each value of the power-law index adopted."}

They also serve as important observational tracers through $γ$-ray emission, radio synchrotron, and secondary particle production. Since CR particles follow power-law distributions in momentum space spanning many decades in energy, and because diffusion and radiative losses further shape these spectra, it is crucial to model spectrally resolved CRs in numerical simulations and to assess the impact of this modeling on gas dynamics and observational signatures. We present a consistent multi-group spectral method in momentum space for CR protons called RAMSES-MCR in the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES, based on the two-moment formalism that evolves both CR energy and number density in momentum space, together with their associated flux. The modeled CR processes include advection, anisotropic/isotropic diffusion, streaming instability, Coulomb and hadronic losses, adiabatic changes, and feedback onto the gas. We also show that the method can be naturally extended to CR electrons (e.g. including synchrotron losses) and generalized to multiple CR species. The implementation is validated against a suite of standard multi-dimensional tests. We finally apply RAMSES-MCR to the three-dimensional expansion of a supernova remnant including CRs with anisotropic diffusion and energy losses, and demonstrate how CR energy redistributes in a momentum-dependent manner and modifies the gas momentum during the snowplough phase."}

We employ a toy model to describe the oscillatory dynamics and its coupling to the field modes, focusing on the resulting effects in the exterior spacetime of the star. The Bogoliubov coefficients relating the in and out vacua are computed non-perturbatively using high-precision numerical methods, without relying on weak-field, small-amplitude or small-velocity expansions. This allows us to determine the full particle spectrum and the total particle number in the strong-field and fully relativistic regime.
