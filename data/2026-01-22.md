Abstract: The AT2017gfo kilonova transient remains a unique multi-messenger event thanks to its proximity (z=0.00987) and the possibility to investigate time-resolved spectra, providing evidence of r-process nucleosynthesis. The kilonova signal was extensively studied in the spectral and time domains, giving key insights into the chemical composition and physical properties of the ejecta. Here, we report the discovery of a novel correlation between two fundamental observables: the peak energy of the EF_E spectrum, Ep, and the isotropic-equivalent luminosity, Liso. In particular, we show that up to about 2.5 days after the merger, the AT2017gfo spectrum evolves according to: log10[Ep/eV] = -0.13 (+0.02/-0.02) + 0.62 (+0.02/-0.02) * log10[Liso/(1e41 erg/s)] (68% C.L.) while in subsequent epochs, Ep remains almost constant with Liso, flattening around 1 eV. Exploiting simulations from a state-of-the-art radiative transfer code, we demonstrate that our kilonova model inherently predicts this peculiar correlation, suggesting a new diagnostic tool for comparing observables against simulations. Future kilonova observations will provide additional insight into the physics behind the Ep-Liso correlation.

Abstract: eROSITA substantiated earlier indications that Loop-I is the northern part of an extended bipolar Galactic-bubble structure, but the southern bubble was not established in nonthermal emission and the shock strength was not robustly measured in either bubble. After using eROSITA data to map the bubble edges, we analyzed edge-adjacent radio and $γ$-ray data to remove foregrounds, test if the southern bubble can be detected in nonthermal emission, and measure the corresponding high-latitude spectra of both bubbles. Data were stacked parallel to the eROSITA bubble edges traced by an edge detector, in the same method used previously to pick up weak signals in the smaller, nested Fermi bubbles; the detected brightness jumps were then used to measure the spectrum. We detect ($>5σ$) both bubble tips in both radio and $γ$-rays, and find a radio spectrum corresponding to high, Mach $3$-$5$ shocks. The southern bubble is fainter, by $\sim$an order of magnitude in radio, its edge propagating into a medium roughly half as dense. The results indicate that these eROSITA bubbles are older, evolved counterparts of the Fermi bubbles, arising from an earlier collimated high-energy outburst from the Galactic center.

Abstract: Fast X-ray transients (FXTs) are flashes of X-rays that last for a few hundreds of seconds to a few hours. An enigmatic population of these transients that did not have a clear origin has been known for several decades, mostly found serendipitously in soft X-ray imaging observations. Recent progress in this field by Einstein Probe has found that many FXTs are associated with gamma-ray bursts and the collapse of massive stars. Motivated by this, we searched the NuSTAR archive in the harder 3--79 keV band for $\sim1000$ s duration transients. From 204 Ms of exposure we present five candidate FXTs, four of which are spectrally hard, with power-law indices $-3<Γ<0$, standing them apart from FXTs discovered in the soft band. Three have potential associations with galaxies at $z=0.1-2$, implying 3--79 keV luminosities of $10^{43}$ to $10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and volumetric event rates of 125--2900 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. The properties of these NuSTAR FXTs most resemble low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts, and would be much more common than their higher-luminosity counterparts in this redshift range.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Conduction as a mechanism for explaining the disrupted cooling-flow in galaxy clusters has been mostly discounted, as the process is inefficient at transporting heat all the way from the cluster into the core. However, thermal conduction can be strongly enhanced when materials of significantly different temperature are brought into proximity, and thus into close thermal contact. Jets of active galactic nuclei may act as heat pumps by bringing low-entropy gas from the cluster core into thermal contact with the hot outer atmosphere of the cluster, significantly increasing the feedback efficiency of active galactic nuclei. We test this hypothesis by running a suite of 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of active galactic nuclei jets in a Perseus-like cluster, including anisotropic conduction. We find that the heat pump efficiency $η$ can reach up to 50\% of the maximum possible efficiency $η_{\rm max}$ if conduction operates near the Spitzer-Braginskii limit, while $η\approx f_{\rm sp}η_{\rm max}$ if conduction along the field lines is substantially suppressed below the Spitzer-Braginskii value by a factor $f_{\rm sp}$ by kinetic effects, as recently suggested. We further find that jet-induced thermal conduction is self-limiting: Magnetic draping during the uplift results in a magnetic field orientation close to perpendicular to the induced temperature gradients, significantly reducing conduction along the ideal conductive pathways. Thus, for conservative assumptions about thermal conduction suppression by $f_{\rm sp} \lesssim 0.1$, the heat pump effect leads to only marginal heat transfer and, correspondingly, to immaterial changes in the overall thermal evolution of cool core clusters beyond the isolated effects of conduction and jet-induced heating alone.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The central compact object (CCO) in the Vela Junior supernova remnant is a young neutron star whose relatively low X-ray flux and small distance suggest it has a mass high enough to activate fast neutrino cooling processes. Here we analyse all XMM-Newton MOS and pn and Chandra ACIS-S spectra of the Vela Junior CCO, with observations taking place over the 9 years from 2001 to 2010. We find that the best-fit flux and spectral model parameters do not vary significantly when treating each observation independently, and therefore we fit all the spectra simultaneously using various spectral models to characterize the predominantly thermal emission from the neutron star surface. Our results indicate the Vela Junior CCO has an atmosphere composed of hydrogen, a hot spot temperature (unredshifted) of 3.5x10^6 K, and a colder surface temperature of (6.6-8.8)x10^5 K. Possible absorption lines at ~0.6 keV and 0.9 keV provide evidence for the first-time of an average surface magnetic field B~3x10^10 G for this CCO, which is similar to the magnetic field of other CCOs. At the accurate new Vela Junior distance of 1.4 kpc, the observed luminosity that is dominated by the hot spot is ~5x10^32 erg s^-1. The luminosity from the rest of the colder surface is (1.3-4.0)x10^32 erg s^-1. The cool luminosity and temperature imply the Vela Junior CCO is indeed colder than many other young neutron stars and probably has a high mass that triggered fast neutrino cooling.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A small fraction of X-ray photons from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), after escaping the relativistic jet, are scattered by electrons in the circumburst medium. Subsequent photon-photon absorption between the incoming MeV $γ$-rays and the back-scattered X-rays generate electron-positron pairs, enriching the surrounding medium with leptons. We investigate how these back-scattered photons modify the prompt GRB spectrum through $γ-γ$ absorption. In a dense and pair-loaded wind environment, the emerging spectra exhibit a broad attenuation structure, whose morphology is sensitive to the low-energy spectral index $α$. In particular, spectra with $α> -1$ develop a pronounced, saddle-shaped absorption between 1 and 100 MeV (rest frame). Such external MeV absorption could account for the spectral curvature seen in some bright GRBs, and may point to enhanced mass loss from their progenitor stars, consistent with early observations of core-collapse supernovae.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate erythrohenosis -- the collision and merger of two red giants -- establishing an end-to-end model for this fundamental evolutionary channel in dense stellar environments. Combining three-dimensional SPH simulations of a binary with analytical modeling, we characterize the event from initial encounter to terminal explosion. We demonstrate that grazing encounters induce tidal capture and rapid orbital decay, accompanied by large-amplitude, nonlinear stellar oscillations. The subsequent inspiral spins up the common envelope into a stable, non-spherical equilibrium, powering a luminous precursor with quasi-periodic bursts. The terminal explosion, modeled with angular momentum conservation, produces an intrinsically flattened remnant that preserves a geometric memory, or morphomnesia, of its binary origin. The associated gravitational wave signal features a rapid, drag-dominated frequency evolution, identifiable by a unique time-varying apparent chirp mass. These results define a distinctive multi-stage observational fingerprint -- linking transient optical precursors, asymmetric nebulae, and anomalous gravitational wave chirps -- to guide identification in current and future multi-messenger surveys.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The dominant radiation mechanism that powers the prompt $γ$-ray emission in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains poorly understood. High quality, time- and energy-resolved linear polarization measurements of prompt $γ$-ray photons can distinguish between synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes and provide crucial constraints on the outflow properties. This will be achieved by POLAR-2 that is proposed as a dedicated GRB polarimeter and successor to POLAR. The High-energy Polarimetry Detector (HPD) is one of the three instruments of POLAR-2 that features significantly improved sensitivity in the $(40-1000)$\,keV energy range and a detection area four times larger than that of POLAR. Here we demonstrate the capabilities of the HPD to constrain key physical model parameters by creating and fitting to synthetic sources using a time-resolved spectro-polarimetric theoretical model of prompt GRB emission. The time-resolved spectral and polarization fits are performed using a novel technique featuring maximum likelihood over an unbinned (in time and energy) list of detected events. The constrained model parameters directly relate to the underlying source physics that would reveal an accelerating, coasting or decelerating emission region. For a pulse fluence of $\mathcal{F}=10^{-5}\mathcal{F}_{-5}\,{\rm erg\,cm^{-2}}$ we can constrain the time-integrated polarization degree to an absolute accuracy ($1\,σ$) of about $2.5\mathcal{F}_{-5}^{\,-1/2}$ per cent, as long as source photons dominate over the background. In bright GRBs, such unprecedented accuracy at these energies will allow to distinguish between different models for the prompt GRB emission mechanism and constrain the magnetic field geometry, jet angular structure and outflow composition.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: I examine a recently proposed failed-supernova scenario for the fading of the yellow supergiant event M31-2014-DS1, and find that it requires unlikely fine-tuned parameters to work, if at all. In the failed-supernova scenario, most of the yellow supergiant collapsed to form a black hole. Due to the energy carried by neutrinos from the cooling, collapsing core, gravity decreases, leading to the ejection of a small fraction of the outer envelope, some of which remains bound. The fallback accreted gas possesses large angular-momentum fluctuations due to the pre-collapse envelope convection. The fallback material forms intermittent accretion disks around the black hole that launch jets (or disk wind), which unbind most of the bound material. The failed-supernova scenario for M31-2014-DS1 requires that only <1% of the bound material be accreted by the black hole, but the jets do not shut down the backflow for over 10 years. I find this fine-tuned requirement unlikely. I also find that, due to the rapid radiative cooling of the outflow interaction zone with the outer gas, the expected radiation is about an order of magnitude or more above the observed value. These, as well as earlier challenges raised against the failed-supernova scenario, make the alternative type II intermediate-luminosity optical transient scenario, in which fading is due to dust ejection in a violent binary interaction, more likely. The fading event M31-2014-DS1 does not support the failed-supernova scenario predicted by the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae.

Abstract: Theoretical models predict that the Galaxy hosts $10^8$-$10^9$ black holes formed from the complete gravitational collapse of heavy stars and that most of these black holes are isolated, without any companion. Within 15 pc of the Solar System ($\sim 50$ ly), there may be a few black holes. If located inside one of the Local Interstellar Clouds - which occupy 5-20% of this local volume - an isolated black hole could produce detectable electromagnetic emission via accretion from the interstellar medium, given the capabilities of current or near-future observatories. However, precise predictions remain challenging due to large uncertainties in the expected accretion spectra. Outside these clouds, the accretion rate would be too low in any standard model to yield a detectable electromagnetic signal. While astrometric detection via gravitational perturbation of nearby stars is conceivable, the local stellar density is too low for this method to be realistically successful. We have searched the Gaia DR3 catalog for candidate isolated black holes accreting from the interstellar medium and identified five sources. All candidates lie close to the Galactic plane, making them likely spurious astrometric solutions, for instance caused by unmodelled background sources (crowding) and/or unmodelled binarity; nevertheless, they cannot be definitively ruled out without follow-up observations.

Abstract: IGR J17091-3624 is a distinctive black hole X-ray binary exhibiting exotic variability, including complex "heartbeat" oscillations in its X-ray light curves, similar to those observed in GRS 1915+105, a system renowned for its structured, rapid X-ray variability but heavily obscured at optical wavelengths. In contrast, IGR J17091-3624 is less obscured, making it a more accessible target for optical investigations. Due to its weak radio emission, optical and infrared data are essential to probe the jet and outer disc behavior of IGR J17091-3624. This study presents the first long-term optical monitoring of IGR J17091-3624, using data from the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) over its 2011, 2016, and 2022 outbursts. We combine these observations with quasi-simultaneous X-ray data from Swift/XRT, RXTE, and NICER, employing light curve and variability analysis, spectral energy distributions, color-magnitude diagrams, and optical/X-ray correlations to investigate optical emission mechanisms. We find that the optical and X-ray fluxes are significantly correlated, following a power-law relation with the index 0.40\pm0.04, suggesting that the optical emission in IGR J17091-3624 is dominated by an X-ray-irradiated accretion disk. Based on optical spectral slope constraints, we estimate the extinction toward IGR J17091-3624 A_V = 4.3 to 6.6 mag. The global optical/X-ray correlation suggests a distance estimate of 8-17 kpc, in line with previous findings. High-cadence optical observations show tentative evidence of optical oscillations that may arise from reprocessed X-ray modulations, although confirming this will require higher time-resolution optical data.

Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are hypothetical particles and compelling candidates for cold dark matter. Their existence could be probed through their conversions into photons in the presence of magnetic fields. In this work, we explore the effect of these photon-ALP conversions by searching for an attenuation in the observed gamma ray spectra of galactic sources that emit at energies of hundreds of TeV. We analyze data from the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory for the source 3HWC J1908+063. No evidence of photon-ALP conversions was found, and we set constraints on the ALP parameter space. Specifically, we derive exclusion limits for ALPs with masses in the range $10^{-8}~\mathrm{eV} \leq m_a \leq 10^{-6}~\mathrm{eV}$ and photon-ALP couplings in the range $10^{-12}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1} \leq g_{aγ} \leq 10^{-10}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$, based on HAWC observations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accretion onto black holes often leads to the launch of outflows that significantly influence their surrounding environments. The two primary forms of these outflows are X-ray disk winds-hot, ionized gases ejected from the accretion disk-and relativistic jets, which are collimated streams of particles often expelled along the rotational axis of the black hole. While previous studies have revealed a general association between spectral states and different types of outflows, the physical mechanisms governing wind and jet formation remain debated. Here, using coordinated NICER and MeerKAT observations of the recurrent black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-472, we identify a clear anti-correlation between X-ray disk winds and jets: during three recent outbursts, only one type of outflow is detected at a time. Notably, this apparent exclusivity occurs even as the overall accretion luminosity remains within the range expected for a standard thin disk, characteristic of the canonical soft state. These results suggest a competition between outflow channels that may depend on how the accretion energy is partitioned between the disk and the corona. Our findings provide new observational constraints on jet and wind formation in X-ray binaries and offer a fresh perspective on the interplay between different modes of accretion-driven feedback.

Abstract: G284.3$-$1.8 is a supernova remnant with a radio shell and thermal X-ray emission. Located near its center is the gamma-ray binary 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856, although the physical association between the two systems is not clear yet. Our X-ray spectroscopy with Suzaku reveals that G284.3$-$1.8 and 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856 have compatible absorption column densities of $N_\mathrm{H} = 6\textrm{--}7 \times 10^{21}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$, indicating that the two systems have similar distances. The actual distance is determined as $3~\mathrm{kpc}$ using $\mathrm{^{12}CO}$ ($J=1\textrm{--}0$) data obtained with NANTEN. The X-ray spectrum of G284.3$-$1.8 shows a strong K-shell emission line of Mg, confirming that the earlier claim that the SNR is one of the few Mg-rich SNRs. Comparing recent stellar models taking into account the "shell merger" processes, we find that the obtained Mg-to-Ne mass ratio of $M_\mathrm{Mg}/M_\mathrm{Ne} = 0.73^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$ and Si-to-Mg mass ratio of $M_\mathrm{Si}/M_\mathrm{Mg} = 0.44\pm0.03$ suggest a supernova explosion that would have left a neutron star. The characteristics of 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856, on the other hand, are better explained with a model in which its compact object is neutron star. The present results, therefore, would suggest a possible scenario where G284.3$-$1.8 and 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856 are both remnants of a common supernova explosion although further observational tests are necessary.

Abstract: Gravitational waves from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) will enable sub-percent measurements of massive black hole parameters and provide access to the demographics of compact objects in galactic nuclei. During the LISA mission, multiple EMRIs are expected to be detected, allowing statistical studies of massive black hole populations and their formation pathways. We perform hierarchical Bayesian inference on simulated EMRI catalogues to assess how well LISA could constrain the astrophysical population using parametrised population models. We test our inference framework on a variety of populations, including heterogeneous and homogeneous mixtures of parametrised subpopulations, and scenarios in which the assumed model is deliberately misspecified. Our results show that population parameters governing distributions with sharp features can be tightly constrained. Mixed populations can be disentangled with as few as $\sim20$ detections, and even with model misspecification, the inference retains sensitivity to key population features. These results demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of EMRI population inference, providing guidance for constructing realistic astrophysical population models for LISA analysis.

Abstract: Returning radiation is thought to play a key role in disk illumination of black hole X-ray binaries in the high-soft state, yet it has not been fully incorporated into XSPEC reflection models. We present a new table model for reflection spectroscopy that, for the first time, self-consistently accounts for the returning radiation. To isolate this effect, we adopt the standard disk-corona configuration but disable the corona, allowing the reflection spectrum to be produced solely by self-irradiation of the disk. Applying our model to the black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630$-$47, we report a rapidly spinning black hole ($a_* \sim 0.99$), a disk inclination of $i \sim 53^\circ$, a mass accretion rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm BH} \sim 15\% \, {\rm \dot{M}_{Edd}}$, and an electron density of $n_{\rm e} \sim 10^{21} \,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ to reproduce the observed reflection features. The model also yields a source distance of $D\sim 8.2 \, {\rm kpc}$, slightly below the commonly adopted value of $10 \, {\rm kpc}$ in the literature. Compared to the widely used relxillNS, our model naturally produces a harder high-energy reflection spectrum, fitting the data without invoking a Comptonized component.

Abstract: We introduce a complete model for dephasing due to line-of-sight acceleration (LOSA) in gravitational wave (GW) signals from stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) in three-body systems. Our prescription provides curvature- and projection-dependent phase features that are not recovered by local-expansion-based treatments. We perform parameter-space surveys and mock parameter inferences assuming the nominal sensitivity of the Einstein Telescope (ET) to identify the regime where the time-varying LOSA allows for separate constraints on the outer orbital parameters, in particular the tertiary mass and distance. We estimate that ET may detect a few to tens of such systems per year, provided that all binaries merge dynamically, and demonstrate that these constraints can be used to directly discriminate between a dynamical and AGN origin for BBHs. Finally, we reanalyse the GW190814 event and four O4a events finding no evidence for LOSA, with the previously claimed LOSA in GW190814 disappearing when a sufficiently long data segment is used.

Abstract: We present a detailed temporal and spectral analysis of the blazar S5\,1044+71 using multi-wavelength data obtained from the \emph{Fermi}-LAT and Swift-XRT/UVOT telescopes. Applying the Bayesian block algorithm to the 3-day binned $γ$-ray lightcurve, we identify pronounced variability, including four major outbursts marked by significant flux enhancements. The highest flux recorded was $(1.1 \pm 0.2)\times 10^{-6}\,\text{ph}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ on 57868.5 MJD. Each outburst comprises multiple components, and lightcurve profile analysis indicates predominantly symmetric temporal structures. The shortest variability timescale of 4.5 hours constrains the emission region to be located within 0.03 pc of the central engine, likely near the broad-line region (BLR). Additionally, two highest-energy photons were detected with energies of 46.4 GeV (on 57739.6 MJD) and 42.5 GeV (on 59161.9 MJD), observed outside the peak flaring activity. The fractional variability shows an overall increasing trend from UV/optical to $γ$-ray bands, with a noticeable dip in the X-ray range, consistent with the shape of the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED). The flux distributions during flares exhibit log-normal or double log-normal behavior, suggesting multiplicative variability processes and evolving emission zones. Cross-correlation analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the $γ$-ray and X-ray bands, with X-rays lagging by 42.5 days. Broadband SED modeling across different flux states supports a one-zone leptonic scenario, with $γ$-ray emission produced via external Compton scattering of IR and BLR photons. High-flux states show harder electron spectra, elevated break energies, and reduced magnetic fields-features consistent with efficient particle acceleration and Compton dominance.

Abstract: The Gaia Alerts system is providing alerts on a variety of objects displaying a significant photometric change detected by the Gaia satellite from one passage to the next one over the same region of the sky. Among the over 22000 alerts published until the end of 2022, around 13 percent concern AGN or quasar candidates. We have embarked on a spectroscopic ground-based follow-up of some of those (including some selected by a different method specifically in galactic nuclei), to establish their true nature, and reveal the various phenomena leading to a change in magnitude of those AGN. The present paper deals with radio-quiet objects, while the radio-loud ones will be described in a companion paper. We confirm, on one hand, the AGN/quasar nature of 64 new candidates alerted by Gaia, and, on the other hand, obtained second-epoch spectra of over 200 known AGN also alerted for large photometric variations. The observed phenomena show a large variety: from Flares to Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) and a large number of Changing Look Quasars (CLQs, 56 secure ones, plus 23 probable ones), not forgetting some rarer events like SNe, microlensing events or Extreme Coronal Line Emitters. This sample shows that variability is an excellent tool to detect new quasars, especially radio-quiet ones that otherwise would be undetected, and that a significant fraction of variable AGN/quasars, around 10 percent, presents the CLQ phenomenon. Some of the new CLQs are followed-up to monitor further changes and measure time scales.

Abstract: We investigate collapsar models with and without self-gravity under identical initial conditions to directly compare the effects of self-gravity on jet properties, such as opening angle, jet power, terminal Lorentz factor, and its variability. We compute a suite of time-dependent, three-dimensional GRMHD simulations of collapsars in evolving spacetime. We update the Kerr metric components due to the growth of the black hole mass and changes its angular momentum. The self-gravity is considered via perturbative terms. We present for the first time the process of jet formation in self-gravitating collapsars. We find that self-gravity leads to temporary jet quenching, which can explain some features in the gamma-ray burst prompt emission. We find no substantial difference in jet launching times between models with and without self-gravity. We observe that in the absence of self-gravity, the jet can extract more rotational energy from the black hole, while self-gravitating models produce narrower jet opening angles. We show that under certain conditions, self-gravity can interrupt the jet formation process, resulting in a failed burst. Our computations show that self-gravity significantly modifies the process of jet propagation, resulting in notably different jet properties. We show that the timescales, variability, and opening angle of jet depend on whether self-gravity is included or not. We argue that self-gravity can potentially explain certain prompt emission properties due to the jet quenching.

Abstract: Extreme synchrotron blazars, characterized by a first peak in their broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at frequencies exceeding $10^{17}$ Hz, often exhibit a second peak beyond 1~TeV. These sources serve as ideal laboratories for studying particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms in relativistic jets. In this work, we systematically analyze the $\sim$16-year Fermi-LAT observational data for 25 extreme high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs (EHBLs). The results indicate that the majority of these sources display stable or low flux levels in the GeV band, with only 6 sources showing significant variability at a confidence level exceeding 5$σ$. The time-averaged spectra over the 16-year period for most EHBLs are well described by a hard power-law model, with photon indices predominantly clustered between 1.7 and 1.8. Using Fermi-LAT data in conjunction with multiwavelength observations compiled from the literature, we construct broadband SEDs for these EHBLs and fit them with a one-zone synchrotron + synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) model. We find that this simplified theoretical framework is sufficient for modeling the observed SEDs of most of these EHBLs, albeit requiring relatively higher electron energies compared to other $γ$-ray emitting HBLs, and at times under-representing the UV emission. Based on the SED fitting results, we investigate the physical properties of the emission regions in these EHBLs and compare them with those of other $γ$-ray emitting HBLs. Consistent with other GeV--TeV $γ$-ray-emitting BL Lacs, the jets in these EHBLs are marked by low radiation efficiency and low magnetization.

Abstract: The gauge gravitation theory in the Riemann-Cartan space-time is investigated in order to solve the fundamental problems of the general relativity theory. The constraints for indefinite parameters of the theory under which solutions of isotropic cosmology describe a nonsingular accelerating Universe are given. Numerical solutions of cosmological equations near the limiting energy density by transition from gravitational compression to expansion in dependence on energy density in the case of flat, closed and open models are obtained. Some physical consequences of gauge gravitational theory in the Riemann-Cartan space-time in astrophysics are discussed.

Abstract: We investigate the excitation of quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in gravitational lensing by a Schwarzschild black hole using a scalar field model. By employing a time-domain mode-sum method, we analyze the complex interplay between an incident burst signal and the black hole spacetime. We find that the incident waves can non-resonantly excite a substantial number of high-$l$ modes, with amplitudes for modes as high as l=20 remaining significant compared to the fundamental l=0 mode. We confirm through QNM template fitting that the late-time behaviors of these excited modes are indeed QNMs. After passing through the black hole, we find that the lensed waves form a highly directional and coherent Gaussian beam whose cross-sectional intensity profile is well-described by a Gaussian profile. Unlike spherical waves, this beam's amplitude does not decrease with distance from the black hole but remains nearly constant in the near-field region. Moreover, due to the superposition of numerous QNMs, oscillations largely cancel each other out. The lensed temporal waves do not exhibit typical oscillatory patterns.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the relation between generalised entropies and the extended uncertainty principle (EUP) models. Starting from the higher-order extended uncertainty principle (HOEUP), we obtain the modified entropy-area relation. Then, we derive the modified Friedmann equations through three different approaches: the first law of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon, the entropic gravity case, and the emergence of cosmic space. Furthermore, we check the validity of the generalised second law (GSL). Notably, HOEUP modified Friedmann equations are the limiting cases of those obtained from a recently proposed novel entropy, which is derived from Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) [{\it Phys. Dark Universe} {\bf 49} (2025) 101967]. Motivated by this connection, we derive a novel EUP, referred to as MOND EUP, from a reverse procedure. This novel EUP reproduces to EUP relations associated with Rényi and dual Kaniadakis entropies in the limiting cases. Moreover, we show that HOEUP corresponds to perturbative limit of MOND entropy. The main new result of this paper is a reverse procedure beginning from a recently proposed novel MOND entropy to construct a unified EUP. This reverse procedure is not limited with the present case. In principle, the method can be applied to other generalised entropy formalisms, suggesting that our findings may establish a unified framework that bridges the generalised entropies, cutoff mechanisms, and EUP models. In particular, the corresponding modified uncertainty principles may have effective cutoff mechanisms for the entropy forms, which do not explicitly display cutoff mechanisms. Thus, these entropies may have cutoff mechanism due to their corresponding modified uncertainty principles.

We characterize their structure and compare them with numerical critical solutions at finite D, identifying both universal features and distinctly large-D behavior.

Abstract: We investigate the detectability of post-Newtonian higher harmonics from Galactic double white dwarfs in the centihertz band ($\sim 0.01$ Hz). Using a synthetic population, we show that, unlike the quadrupole mode, higher harmonics remain undetectable with LISA except for rare nearby systems. In contrast, planned mid-band (decihertz) observatories such as DECIGO and BBO will be able to detect the third harmonic for about 10\% of inspiral binaries above $\sim 5$ mHz, enabling statistical constraints on mass ratios. These results highlight the successive roles of LISA and future decihertz missions in establishing a coherent strategy for space-based gravitational-wave astronomy.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We examine the role of angular momentum in general relativity from both heuristic and fully covariant perspectives, with the aim of clarifying conceptual ambiguities that arise when Newtonian intuition is extrapolated into the relativistic regime. Focusing on free--fall dynamics in the Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes in the test--particle limit, we employ an effective--potential heuristic approach to isolate the roles of the specific energy $E$, specific angular momentum $L$, and black--hole spin $a$. Within this framework, we identify well--defined regions of parameter space in which the Kerr spacetime leads to stronger or weaker local radial infall than the Schwarzschild case at the same radius. By analysing the kinematics of infalling geodesic congruences, we show how these local regimes combine along complete trajectories to either enhance or reduce gravitational focusing. We then interpret these results within a covariant 1+3 description of general relativity, in terms of the expansion, shear and Raychaudhuri evolution of timelike congruences. We demonstrate that black--hole rotation systematically modifies the shear of infalling irrotational flows, even when the magnitude of the local expansion is reduced, and that this shear modulation governs the overall rate of focusing. Our work complements previous studies of relativistic infall by providing a unified energetic and geometric interpretation of how angular momentum and rotation can strengthen or weaken gravitational collapse relative to the non--rotating case.

Abstract: In this analysis, we investigate the polarization radiation imaging of Kerr-Newman black holes, with a particular focus on the impact of black hole charge on photon propagation and polarization characteristics. By extending the traditional Walker-Penrose method, which is limited by its reliance on specific symmetric structures and Killing tensors, we overcome these limitations by constructing an ordinary differential equations (ODEs) numerical framework that combines the photon orbit equation with the polarization parallel transport equation. This allows for the self-consistent evolution of photon trajectories and polarization states in any spacetime backgrounds without relying on specific symmetries. Using this framework, we analyze the effects of black hole spin and charge on the polarization characteristics of radiation from both prograde and retrograde accretion disks. Our results show that black hole charge can significantly modify photon trajectories and polarization patterns: increasing charge compresses and distorts the EVPA structure on photon-ring scales, inducing localized rotations and asymmetries that may provide a potential diagnostic of a nonzero black hole charge.

Abstract: We investigate the geometry of a tidally deformed, rotating black hole and timelike geodesics in its vicinity. Our framework provides a local picture of the structural evolution of a relativistic restricted three-body problem around a deformed black hole in an adiabatically evolving binary, motivated by various astrophysical settings including disk dynamics and extreme mass-ratio inspirals. As the tidal-field strength is increased, initially regular, bound geodesics undergo four stages: (i) weak chaos emerges within the bound motion; (ii) a subset of trajectories plunges into the black hole; (iii) a fraction of the remaining trajectories becomes unbound; and (iv) no bound trajectories persist. We provide semi-analytic estimates for the critical tidal amplitudes associated with each transition. Our estimates indicate that, within the frequency band of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, the matter flow around black holes may already be depleted, whereas LISA and (B-)DECIGO could probe the earlier stages. Our results suggest that an object orbiting a tidally deformed massive BH may remain near resonances over a wide range of separations, indicating an accumulated, non-negligible impact on the gravitational-wave phase. Tidal perturbations can also introduce nonlinear couplings among epicyclic oscillations of geodesics, offering a potential avenue to resonant excitation of quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray light curves from accreting black holes.

Finally, we provide forecasts for the accessible parameter space using current and future gravitational wave detectors.

Abstract: We derive exact general solutions (as opposed to attractor particular solutions) for the evolution of a scalar field $φ$ in a universe dominated by a background fluid with equation of state parameter $w_B = -1$, extending earlier work on exact solutions with $w_B > -1$. Straightfoward exact solutions exist when the evolution is described by a linear differential equation, corresponding to constant, linear, and quadratic potentials. In the nonlinear case, exact solutions are derived for $V = V_0\ln φ$, $V = V_0 φ^{1/2}$ and $V = V_0/φ$, and the logarithmic potential also yields an exact first integral. These complicated parametric solutions are considerably less useful than those derived previously for a universe dominated by a barotropic fluid such as matter or radiation with $w_B > -1$. However, we generalize the slow-roll approximation and show that it applies to all sufficiently flat potentials in the case of a vacuum-dominated expansion, while it never applies when the universe is dominated by a background fluid with $w_B > -1$.

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{WaveletNet}$, a wavelet-based neural network architecture to identify and reduce non-Gaussian noise in gravitational wave data. Traditionally, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used as a flexible machine learning method to mitigate non-Gaussian noise. However, training CNNs requires many data samples, especially when the input data segments are long. Glitches that mimic high-mass black hole signals are empirically known to have a wavelet-like structure. We exploit this property in $\texttt{WaveletNet}$ by using simple neural networks to learn the best family of wavelets to model glitches in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 data. Due to its simplicity, our framework is significantly more sample-efficient than CNNs. As a use case, we build upon the $\texttt{TIER}$ method and show how $\texttt{WaveletNet}$ can improve the performance of any search pipeline. We take potential GW candidates from the pipeline, and then downweight the candidates having noisy strain regions in their vicinity. We use our framework in a modular way: we provide an output score which can be added to the pipeline's existing detection statistic score for the candidates. We test our method using candidates from the $\texttt{IAS-HM}$ search pipeline and show that it improves the search sensitive volume by up to 15% for high-mass, asymmetric binaries.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) field has been accompanied by a simultaneous growth of FRB conferences. While these meetings are essential for interacting with other researchers and establishing collaborations, many remain only accessible to those with substantial travel funding, flexible schedules, or geographical proximity. This introduces barriers that predominantly affect early career researchers (ECRs) and people from under-resourced regions, limiting the growth, diversity, and sustainability of the community. To address these issues, the FRB 2025 conference, held in Montréal in July 2025 with over 200 participants, was designed to prioritize inclusivity and accessibility alongside scientific excellence. In this work, we describe how we implemented these goals, including: organizing committees spearheaded by ECRs, a fully hybrid format including YouTube livestreams, low registration fees, a pedagogical day at the beginning of the conference, local vegetarian catering, and the implementation of flash-talks instead of posters. From a post-conference survey of participants, we were able to assess the effectiveness of our initiatives. Notably, we received very positive feedback from the online participants, which amounted to roughly half of the attendees, especially regarding the livestreams and talk recordings. The pedagogical day was also greatly appreciated. The low registration fees naturally led to challenges, in particular with the audio-visual management, and although areas for improvement were noted, such as poster sessions and support for attendees requiring visas, the conference was generally viewed as a success. Our experience demonstrates that highly accessible, hybrid conferences are possible within modest budgets ($\$20$k CAD), and we outline recommendations for future conferences, both in the FRB field and in other domains.

Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will be a large ultraviolet/optical/near-infrared space telescope operating at the Sun-Earth Lagrange point L2. HWO was highly recommended by the National Academies` 2020 decadal survey and will be the first telescope designed specifically to search for life on planets orbiting other stars. HWO will also be able to perform a host of other transformational astrophysics, including cosmology, galaxy evolution, solar system science, and beyond. The development of the telescope and instrument suite is an iterative process. Example observatory architectures, called exploratory analytic cases (EACs) by the HWO Technology Maturation Project Office (TMPO), are modeled end-to-end to explore the engineering and science trade space. Recently, an ultraviolet Integral Field Spectrograph (UV IFS) was added to HWO's instrument suite for the EACs 4 and 5. To explore the science and engineering trade space for this specific instrument, we developed a high-fidelity UV IFS simulation tool, PyISH. The UV IFS simulation tool is designed to be used by scientists to model specific science cases as seen by a UV IFS on HWO, as well as engineers to explore the trade space when developing potential instrument architectures. The modular components, deliverables, and an example of the tool simulating a specific science case proposed for HWO are described in this paper.

Abstract: High-contrast imaging systems using active control with adaptive optics (AO) are often limited by non-common path (NCP) aberrations that are seen only at the final science image. AO systems employing focal-plane wavefront sensors (FP-WFSs) are able to simultaneously correct NCP aberrations and measure science images, but they typically require a second stage of control that adds system cost and complexity. We present control algorithms to augment AO systems with FP-WFSs within their existing control setup. We demonstrate inter-arm NCP aberration transfer can be mitigated through temporal filtering, present frequency- and time-domain validation of controller stability and performance, and discuss the optimality of the chosen controllers. This work will enable the development, testing, and installation of FP-WFS technologies for direct imaging of exoplanets.

Abstract: In a recent publication [R. C. Tautz and I. Lerche, Res. Astron. Astrophys. 16, 162 (2016); arXiv:1606.08272], the authors present a derivation of the Green's function for the three-dimensional telegraph equation (also known as the heat wave equation, or relativistic heat conduction equation). We demonstrate that the closed-form expression derived in their Appendix A is incorrect. Specifically, the published solution lacks a Dirac delta term representing the ballistic wavefront and contains an algebraic error in the prefactor of the wake term. These omissions arise from the neglect of distributional derivatives when differentiating a Heaviside step function. We provide a rigorous derivation of the Green's function using the Fourier transform method, verify the correct limiting behavior as the damping vanishes, and pinpoint the exact mathematical step where the original derivation failed.
