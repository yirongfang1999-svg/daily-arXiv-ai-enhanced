Abstract: Adaptive optics can be used to mitigate the effects of atmospheric turbulence on imaging systems, but the correction is only partial, and deconvolution is often required to improve the resolution. This results in entire optical/digital systems, which are traditionally designed sequentially, i.e. , the adaptive optics system is optimised first, and the restoration algorithms are designed a second time. Studies on optical/digital systems have shown that jointly optimizing the whole system is a better alternative. We propose to extend these co-design strategies to the design of an adaptive optics-assisted imaging system. We derive a simple criterion that takes into account the source properties and the entire optical/ digital system performance. To illustrate its interest, we use it to optimize the wavelength distribution between the wavefront sensor and the imaging camera. In addition, we explore the potential of using multiple imaging channels operating at different wavelengths as a means of making an imaging system robust to turbulence strength and source magnitude variations. Later, any parameter of the optical/digital system, if not the entire system itself, could be optimized this way.

Abstract: During its annual conference in 2025, the French Society of Astronomy \& Astrophysics (SF2A) hosted, for the fifth time, a special session dedicated to discussing the environmental transition within the French A\&A research community. During the 2025 workshop, the goal was to review four contemporary topics within the context of environmental transition actions and discussions: (1) institutional actions, (2) the early-career researchers singularity, (3) research infrastructures and tools, and (4) the geopolitical conditions under which A\&A research remains possible. The workshop concluded with a round-table discussion that brought together the various speakers so that every participant could express their ideas.

Abstract: Neutron monitors are a standard tool for high-precision continuous monitoring of galactic cosmic ray flux variations arising from variations in heliospheric conditions and solar activity for space weather applications. These measurements form the basis for solving the inverse problem of determining the cosmic ray anisotropy vector beyond the magnetosphere. To support such studies, periodic latitude measurements are necessary to determine the coupling functions of primary and secondary cosmic rays variations. The aim of this work is to develop and characterize a modernized standard neutron monitor based on a CHM-15 boron thermal neutron counter and a data acquisition system designed for marine expeditionary studies of cosmic ray variations. Modern nuclear physics experimental methods and the principles of microprocessor-based data acquisition systems were used to solve this problem. The results of test trials and of continuous monitoring showed that the characteristics of the upgraded and standard neutron monitor are similar, and the ease of use, compactness, and stability allow us to conclude that the mobile neutron detector can be used in expeditionary conditions with limited access for maintenance personnel.

Abstract: Numerical end-to-end simulation in Adaptive Optics (AO) is a key tool in the development of complex systems, from the initial design to the commissioning phase. Based on our previous experience with PASSATA, we decided to develop a new AO simulation framework in Python language, naming it SPECULA (short for: Scalable Parallel Execution of Computations Upscaling Large Adaptive optics simulations). Following an object-oriented approach, the physical entities are modeled as processing objects connected to each other to exchange data objects. A simulation is run by providing its description instead of writing and executing a specific script. The Python language and its library flexibility allowed us to write one single code that can be run on CPU and GPU platforms. We put a strong focus on computational efficiency, relying on CuPy and its interface to access the CUDA-stream mechanism. Moreover, SPECULA is capable of distributed computations over multiple processing nodes, making it suitable to run in an HPC environment, as tested on the Italian supercomputer Leonardo. SPECULA can also be used in laboratory environment to implement a hybrid simulation, allowing us to interface simulated and concrete objects: this feature was demonstrated in the Adaptive Optics laboratories at Arcetri Observatory. In this paper, we describe the main characteristics of SPECULA, show some relevant examples of its use, and finally draw our goals for the future.

Abstract: The LISA mission will be the first observatory to detect gravitational waves from space within the millihertz frequency band. Magnetic forces have an important impact on the instrument's sensitivity below the millihertz. Hence, monitoring the magnetic environment within each of the LISA spacecrafts is of utmost importance. In this Letter we present the characterization of the coils that were used in LISA Pathfinder (LPF) when operating as magnetic sensors in the audio frequency band. The necessity of implementing this type of magnetometer is presented in order to monitor high frequency magnetic signals from the electronics on-board. We show that the LPF coils have a performance one order of magnitude better than the current requirements set by the LISA mission at the low end of the audio-band frequency. The LPF coils are able to measure a magnetic noise level of 1.45 $\rm pT/\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$ at 50 Hz and 0.17 $\rm pT/\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$ at 500 Hz. Additionally, the LPF coils can reach a magnetic noise floor of 0.1 $\rm pT/\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$ at frequencies above 1 kHz.

Abstract: Multi-messenger astronomical observations of neutron stars, together with more precise calculations and constraints coming from dense matter microphysics, are generating tension with regard to equations of state models used to describe neutron star cores. Assuming an abrupt first-order phase transition with a slow conversion speed between phases, we propose different slow stable hybrid star configurations aiming to reconcile all current constraints simultaneously; within this framework, we also introduce a novel non-CSS parametrization to the quark matter equation of state and discuss its strengths and limitations. We analyze our model results in conjunction with a review of other relevant theoretical possibilities existing in the literature. We found that modern neutron star observations seem to favor the existence of some type of exotic matter in the neutron star cores; in particular, our slow stable hybrid star scenario remains a proposal capable of satisfying these constraints. However, due both to the existing skepticism regarding some of the adopted hypotheses in most extreme neutron star measurements and to the precise adjustment needed for the equation-of-state parameters, significant tension and open questions remain.

Abstract: X-ray binaries, powered by black holes, neutron stars, or white dwarfs accreting matter from a companion star, are among the brightest beacons in galaxies, outshining the Sun by a factor of millions. Most emit primarily above 0.3 keV in X-rays, but cooler thermal sources peaking in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) would be much more difficult to detect due to astronomy's critical blind spot in EUV. Here, we report the discovery of a remarkable new class of luminous, point-like, non-nuclear X-ray objects in galaxies-hypersoft X-ray sources -- that have been missed by all previous surveys to date. Detected primarily or exclusively below 0.3 keV, with 0.15-0.3 keV to 0.3-1.0 keV photon ratios >8, the most luminous examples radiate >1E38 erg/s in the narrow X-ray band, with spectral models indicating even greater bolometric luminosities, largely emitted in the EUV. They rank among the most energetic sources in galaxies, yet their EUV-peaking spectra evaded earlier detections. We propose that hypersoft sources are X-ray binaries spanning multiple physical classes, including accreting white dwarfs or post-nova systems-potential Type Ia supernova progenitors-and systems hosting accreting black holes. Beyond their elusive nature, they may play crucial role in ionizing gas within galaxies.

Abstract: Extragalactic fast X-ray transients (eFXTs) represent a rapidly growing class of high-energy phenomena, whose physical origins remain poorly understood. With its wide-field, sensitive all-sky monitoring, the Einstein Probe (EP) has greatly increased the discovery rate of eFXTs. The search and identification of the optical counterparts of eFXT are vital for understanding their classification and constraining their physical origin. Yet, a considerable fraction of eFXTs still lack secure classifications due to the absence of timely follow-up observations. We carry out a systematic search of publicly available optical survey data and transient databases (including the Zwicky Transient Facility, ZTF, and the Transient Name Server, TNS) for optical counterparts to eFXT candidates detected by EP. In this paper, we describe our ongoing program and report the first results. Specifically, we identified the eFXT EP240506a to be associated with a UV/optical counterpart, AT 2024ofs. Spectroscopy of its host galaxy with VLT yields a redshift of $z = 0.120 \pm 0.002$. By combining archival survey data with early-time multiwavelength observations, we find that the luminosity and light-curve evolution of AT~2024ofs are consistent with a core-collapse supernova origin. From detectability simulations, we estimate a local event rate density $ρ_{0}=8.8^{+21.2}_{-3.9}\ \mathrm{yr^{-1}\, Gpc^{-3}}$ for EP240506a-like events, and completeness-corrected rate of about $36$--$78\ \mathrm{yr^{-1}\ Gpc^{-3}}$ for EP-detected X-ray transients associated with supernovae. Our results demonstrate the potential of EP to uncover prompt high-energy emission from core-collapse supernovae and underscore the critical importance of timely follow-up of future eFXT events.

Abstract: We present sensipy, an open-source Python toolkit for simulating observations of transient astrophysical sources, particularly in the high-energy (HE, keV-GeV) and very-high-energy (VHE, GeV-TeV) gamma-ray ranges. The most explosive events in our universe are often short-lived, emitting the bulk of their energy in a relatively narrow time window. Due to often rapidly fading emission profiles, understanding how and when to observe these sources is crucial both to test theoretical predictions and efficiently optimize available telescope time. The information extracted from the tools included in sensipy can be used to help astronomers investigate the detectability of sources considering various theoretical assumptions about their emission processes and mechanisms. This information can further help to justify the feasibility of proposed observations, estimate detection rates (events/year) for various classes of sources, and provide scheduling insight in realtime during gamma-ray and multi-messenger observational campaigns.

Abstract: Femtolensing of gamma ray bursts (GRBs) are vastly studied to constrain the primordial black hole (PBHs) lighter than $10^{-13}$ solar mass and may close the window for PBH dark matter. In this case, wave optics formalism is required and carefully implemented in our analysis. Incorporating the GRB observational data from Swift XRT, we perform the statistic analysis of PBH lensing, comparing with null hypothesis where BAND model is used to parametrize the GRB spectrum. We found few GRB data manifest the spectral fringe which characterize the feature of femtolensing by PBHs, and the analysis shows moderate statistical preference in terms of goodness of fit. Conversely, since most of the fitting to GRB spectral data do not improved with PBH lensing, we utilize to obtain upper bound on the PBH fractional abundance with respect to dark matter. However, the robust constraint cannot be achieved, unless the size of GRBs are smaller than $5\times10^{7}$ m for PBH mass around $5\times10^{-15}$ solar mass.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The magnetar Swift J1834.9-0846 presents a significant challenge to neutron star spin-down models. It exhibits two key anomalies: an insufficient rotational energy loss rate to power its observed X-ray luminosity, and a braking index of $ = 1.08\pm 0.04$, which starkly contradicts the canonical magnetic dipole value of $n=3$. To explain these anomalies, we develop a unified spin-evolution model that self-consistently integrates magnetic dipole radiation, gravitational wave emission, and wind braking. Within this framework, we constrain the wind braking parameter to $κ\in [13, 37]$ from the nebular properties, finding it contributes substantially (17%-51%) to the current spin-down torque. Bayesian inference reveals that the birth period is poorly constrained by present data and is prior-dependent, indicating a millisecond birth is allowed but not required. Furthermore, we constrain the number of precession cycles to $ξ\sim 10^{4}$--$10^{5}$, and our analysis favors a toroidally-dominated internal magnetic field configuration as the most self-consistent explanation for the low braking index. Finally, we assess the continuous gravitational-wave detectability. The present-day signal is undetectable. However, the early-time signal might have reached the projected sensitivity of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories, such as the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (aLIGO) and the Einstein Telescope (ET), although a confident detection would require exceptionally stable rotation, an assumption considered highly optimistic for a young magnetar. This work establishes a unified framework that links magnetar spin-down with their interior physics and multi-messenger observables, providing a physically consistent interpretation for Swift J1834.9-0846 and a new tool for understanding similar extreme neutron stars.

Abstract: We construct exotic compact objects composed entirely of self-interacting asymmetric fermionic dark matter governed by a repulsive Yukawa potential with massive dark interaction boson. By considering the structural, tidal, and rotational properties of solar mass self-gravitating dark matter systems, and contrasting them against purely baryonic neutron stars, described by the well understood SLy4 equation of state, we hope to shed some light on the place of dark compact systems in the context of gravitational wave astronomy, specifically due to the difficulty parsing mass and radius data from events with no electromagnetic counterpart. Here we consider systems composed of 1 GeV and 10 GeV dark matter. Relevant compact objects are then analysed and simulated as both static bodies, and rotating systems governed by the Hartle-Thorne formalism to second order. Here within we highlight the differences in key tidal and rotational properties encoded in gravitational wave signals, and analyse how dark objects may mimic or distinguish themselves to current and future gravitational wave observatories.

Abstract: Host galaxies of tidal disruption events (TDEs) show enhanced central stellar concentration and are preferentially found in post-starburst and green valley populations. This connection has led to the proposal that TDE host galaxies likely have gone through recent mergers. We conduct a new morphological study of 14 TDE host galaxies, using the r-band images from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), and Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), with the images from the latter two surveys having much higher depth and resolution than SDSS. We examine galaxy structures using conventional methods and also apply diagnostics of merger activity from machine learning models. Consistent with previous studies, our results show that TDE host galaxies are ~16% more centrally concentrated when compared to non-TDE-host controls. However, surprisingly, TDE hosts lack any indication of recent merger activity from both morphological analysis and our machine learning merger classifier. Instead, our results reveal that TDE host galaxies are approximately 1.5 to 2.5 times more likely to have bar-like or ring-like structures than their controls. This enhancement is even more prominent for TDEs in the green valley, with the factor reaching almost 3. Based on these results, we propose that bar-driven secular evolution, instead of merger, likely dominates the recent evolution of TDE hosts found in the green valley, which can simultaneously explain their distinctive nuclear properties and enhanced TDE rates.

Abstract: The quasar OP 313 was discovered in December 2023 in very-high-energy $γ$ rays above 100 GeV, enabling for the first time a complete characterization of its emission. However, the lack of updated measurements of its accretion disk, broad line region and dusty torus hampers a detailed interpretation of the role of accretion in the observed $γ$-ray production. We intend to characterize, during high-activity states, the external photon fields contributing to the IR-to-UV emission$-$namely dusty torus, broad line region and accretion disk$-$and investigate potential variability and blurring effects on the broad emission lines. We present new spectroscopic observations of OP 313 with the NOT and TNG telescopes to characterize its optical spectrum and variability with respect to archival observations from SDSS. We measure the luminosity of different broad emission lines, characterizing the broad line region, accretion disk and dusty torus. We measure the Mg II emission line, with an average flux of $F_{\mathrm{Mg \ II}} = (0.85 \pm 0.11)\times 10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Its equivalent width and luminosity are consistent with a constant line with a variable non-thermal continuum. From the stable Mg II line we derive a constant luminosity of the thermal components, $\log(L_{\mathrm{BLR}} \ \mathrm{[erg \ s^{-1}]}) = 44.91 \pm 0.19$, $\log(L_{\mathrm{disk}} \ \mathrm{[erg \ s^{-1}]}) = 45.91 \pm 0.19$ and $\log(L_{\mathrm{torus}} \ \mathrm{[erg \ s^{-1}]}) = 44.70 \pm 0.16$, and estimated a BH mass of $\log(M_{BH}/M_{\odot})=8.36 \pm 0.18$, in line with with that derived from the C III] line. These characteristics and the indicator of the accretion rate from the disk/Eddington luminosity ratio $λ=L_{AD}/L_{Edd} = 0.23 \pm 0.10$, along with a high Compton dominance, favour a FSRQ-like nature, contrary to the argued changing-look nature.

Abstract: We revisit the spectral appearance of extended self-gravitating accretion disks around supermassive black holes. Using dust-poor opacity tables, we show that all optically thick disk solutions possess a universal outer effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}\sim 4000-4500$K, closely resembling compact, high-redshift sources known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Assuming the extended disk is primarily heated by stellar sources, this ``disk Hayashi limit" fixes the dominant optical continuum temperature of the disk spectrum independent of accretion rate $\dot{M}$, black hole mass $M_\bullet$, and disk viscosity $α$, and removes the parameter-tuning required in previous disk interpretations of LRDs. We construct global self-gravitating accretion disk models with radially varying accretion rates, suggesting that burning of embedded stellar objects can both efficiently power the emission of the outer disk and hollow out the inner disk, strongly suppressing variable UV/X-ray associated with a standard quasar. The resulting disk emission is dominated by a luminous optical continuum while a separate, non-variable UV component arises from stellar populations on the nuclear to galaxy scale. We map the optimal region of parameter space for such systems and show that LRD-like appearances are guaranteed for $\dot{M}/α\gtrsim 0.1 M_\odot /{\rm yr}$, a threshold insensitive to $M_\bullet$, below which the system may transition into classical non-self-gravitating AGN disks, potentially a later evolution stage. We expect this transition to be accompanied by the enhancement of metallicity and production of dust, giving rise to far infrared emission. This picture offers a physically motivated and quantitative framework connecting LRDs with AGNs and their associated nuclear stellar population.

Abstract: General Relativity (GR) has been tested extensively in the solar system and is being tested in the new environment of the Galactic Centre (GC) black hole where the dimensionless gravitational potential ($GM/c^2r$) is 100 times stronger than the one encountered in solar system. Therefore, the neighbourhood of the GC black hole is a naive opportunity to test modified theories of gravity. In this work, effect of $f(R)$ gravity near the black hole is studied. The difference of pericentre shift between GR and $f(R)$ gravity is studied for compact orbits having semi-major axis equal to and below $a=1000$ au (S0-2 like orbits). In a model dependent approach, we choose $f(R) \propto R^2$ (power law gravity) model which is cosmologically motivated and study the deviation in orbital pericentre shift for both zero spin and non-zero spin of the black hole. It is found that effect of $f(R)$ gravity becomes prominent for compact orbits. In model independent approach to $f(R)$ gravity with the generic scalaron fields ($ψ=f'(R)$), we extract the parameters of $f(R)$ gravity from the current bounds on Parametrised Post Newtonian (PPN) parameters ($γ, β$) near the GC black hole. The screening of $f(R)$ gravity is also investigated for these bounds on PPN parameters. It has been found that sufficiently massive scalarons ($10^{-16}$ eV) are completely screened but light and intermediate mass scalarons ($10^{-22}$ eV and $10^{-19}$ eV) are unscreened towards S0-2 like orbits as well as in the orbit of the newly discovered short period star S4716 ($a=407$ au). The possibility of detection of the $f(R)$ gravity effects due to these unscreened scalarons is forecasted with existing and upcoming astrometric capabilities of Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs).

Abstract: The Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP) are modifications to the Heisenberg Uncertainly Principle (HUP), expected to apply as the energy approaches the Planck scale. Here we consider a possible combination of these modifications (GEUP) and analyse the implications in various regions of the ($Δx$, $Δp$) plane. We also consider an alternative combination (EGUP) which exhibits duality between $Δp$ and $Δx$, showing that this has some unusual features. The parameters which describe these models are usually assumed to be positive but we extend our analysis to include negative values. All these proposals entail a link between black holes and the various types of Uncertainty Principle. In particular, the GEUP predicts a new kind of strong-gravity black hole and this implies an interesting link between black holes and elementary particles.

Abstract: The parallel theory of relativity predicts conserved energy-momentum currents for an arbitrary metric, without invoking Killing symmetries. By treating the reference frame as an independent variational field and requiring it to carry no energy, the theory naturally unifies Einstein's two formulations of gravity and yields uniquely defined covariant charges. In isotropic and homogeneous cosmology, the canonical time direction selected by the reference frame coincides with the Kodama vector, and the associated Noether energy reproduces the Misner-Sharp mass.

Abstract: In this study, we extend Leaver's continued fraction method to evaluate black hole quasinormal modes (QNMs) in systems where the effective potential exhibits a discontinuity. Besides the low-lying modes, we particularly focus on high overtones, which are physically pertinent due to the substantial deformation of the QNM spectrum triggered by spectral instability. In our algorithm, we expand the wavefunction at the point of discontinuity, instead of the black hole horizon, and incorporate the Israel-Lanczos-Sen junction conditions. %As the wavefunction convergence condition becomes irrelevant, our proposed algorithm generalizes the original method by expanding the wavefunctions at the point of discontinuity, and the associated difficulty is mitigated by rectifying the recurrence relations between the expansion coefficients to incorporate the Israel-Lanczos-Sen junction conditions. We apply this algorithm to compute the QNMs of the modified Regge-Wheeler potential up to $2000$ modes with high precision. For the low-lying modes, the numerical results show excellent agreement with those obtained using the matrix and Prony methods. The high overtones are significantly deformed, owing to the presence of echoes due to the discontinuity. This deformation in the asymptotic QNM spectrum reveals universal features that are largely independent of the specific form of the discontinuity in the potential, seemingly coinciding with those observed in the modified Pöschl-Teller effective potential. We speculate on whether the collective effect of the high overtones has an observational impact on gravitational wave signals.

Abstract: Tilt-to-length (TTL) noise induced by angular jitter of spacecraft and test masses can affect the sensitivity of space-based gravitational-wave detectors such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin. Such angular jitter can be measured using the differential wavefront sensing technique, enabling the modeling and subtraction of TTL noise from the data. However, owing to the multiple degrees of freedom of the detector constellation, a linear TTL model requires at least 24 parameters, while a higher-fidelity quadratic model involves up to 60 coefficients, rendering parameter estimation computationally expensive. To accelerate parameter determination, we propose a modified parameter set obtained via a linear transformation of the original angular coupling coefficients, which effectively reduces correlations among TTL noise components. In addition, we perform parameter fitting using an alternative second-generation time-delay interferometry configuration, PD4L, rather than the fiducial Michelson configuration. These two improvements enhance the convergence speed of the fitting procedure by a factor of approximately 10 for the linear model and approximately 18 for the quadratic model. The proposed approach can therefore substantially improve the efficiency of TTL noise calibration in space-based gravitational-wave detectors.

Abstract: We investigate the details of the canonical quantization of effective quantum field theories in anti-de Sitter spacetime, emphasizing the stability of the quantum vacuum. We take the scalar and Maxwell fields as examples. For the non-minimally coupled massless real scalar field with ξRφ^2 term in the Lagrangian (mass can be introduced by shift of ξ), only when ξ\le 5/48, the quantized Hamiltonian is spontaneously non-negative and the vacuum is well defined. For ξ> 5/48, one has to assign the negative energy spectrum as that of the ghost particles, introducing anti-commutation relations to make the corresponding part of the Hamiltonian trivial, ensuring the Hamiltonian non-negative and the vacuum (and the Hilbert space) well defined. This method of ghost states is applicable once the proper radial boundary conditions guarantee the Hamiltonian self-adjoint. The resulting dynamics can be compared with those resulting from the positive self-adjoint extensions when the latter is available for ξ\le 9/48. For the Maxwell fields, the gauge invariant canonical energy momentum tensor straightforwardly leads to the gauge invariant non-negative Hamiltonian (well-defined vacuum). Hence the redundant gauge degree of freedom is irrelevant, and the 2-dimensional dynamical degrees of freedom are quantized in a concrete, e.g., temporal gauge. The energy momentum tensors for both quantized fields are renormalized to be finite at operator level, which renders the stable vacuum maximally symmetric. The back-reactions to the background spacetime by excited states via the semi-classical Einstein equations are also discussed.

Abstract: We construct a gravastar configuration within the Shtanov-Sahni (SS) braneworld scenario, characterized by a timelike extra dimension and negative brane tension. Unlike classical black holes, which inevitably culminate in central curvature singularities, our model demonstrates that the SS braneworld dynamics naturally regularize the interior geometry and prevent singularity formation. By solving the modified Einstein field equations induced on the brane, we obtain explicit interior, shell, and exterior solutions without invoking the idealized thin-shell approximation. The gravastar core is modeled as a Bose--Einstein condensate, while the intermediate shell consists of ultra-dense stiff matter. Bulk Weyl corrections induce anisotropic effective pressures on the brane, a feature that emerges intrinsically in this scenario and supports stability. We analyze the active gravitational mass, energy, entropy, and proper thickness of the shell, and establish the junction conditions at the interfaces. Our analysis reveals that the SS gravastar exhibits suppressed or even negative effective mass, reflecting the repulsive nature of the interior condensate, and admits stable equilibrium solutions consistent with energy conditions. This highlights the SS braneworld gravastar as a physically viable compact object and a compelling alternative to black holes. A key novelty of our construction is that the stabilizing pressure anisotropy and suppressed effective gravitational mass arise dynamically from higher-dimensional Weyl corrections, rather than being imposed through ad hoc matter sources or thin-shell idealizations. This provides the first fully analytic realization of a finite-thickness, stable gravastar in the Shtanov-Sahni braneworld, highlighting a genuinely geometric mechanism for singularity avoidance in compact objects.

Abstract: We introduce the concept of timelike entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation as a novel probe of the black hole information paradox. By analytically continuing black hole spacetimes to Euclidean signature, we define timelike correlations that reveal a sequence of timelike Page times at which the entanglement entropy equals the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Applying this framework to Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström, static higher-dimensional and braneworld solutions, four-dimensional Kerr, and higher-dimensional rotating Myers--Perry black holes, we demonstrate that timelike entanglement exhibits periodic or quasi-periodic behavior, with the recurrence times sensitive to surface gravity, charge, rotation, and spacetime dimensionality. Extremal and near-extremal black holes display effectively frozen thermal oscillations with persistent rotational modulation, reflecting their near-horizon geometries. Unlike conventional approaches based on islands or firewalls, our framework encodes information entirely in the Hawking radiation, preserving unitarity while avoiding violations of horizon smoothness. These results establish timelike entanglement as a robust and physically transparent mechanism for information recovery and provide a versatile tool for exploring quantum gravitational dynamics across a wide range of black hole spacetimes.

Abstract: The detection of black hole scalar hair, a possible deviation from general relativity's "no-hair" theorem, requires sensitive probes beyond conventional methods. This study proposes chaotic dynamics as a novel indicator for scalar hair in Horndeski gravity. We investigate the motion of a spinning test particle in a static, spherically symmetric hairy black hole spacetime. Our results show that increasing scalar hair systematically suppresses orbital chaos, as evidenced by regularized precession, reduced Lyapunov exponents, and contracted Poincare sections. Furthermore, scalar hair enhances the correlation between the two gravitational wave polarization modes, restoring phase coherence. These findings demonstrate that chaotic observables and gravitational wave signatures can jointly serve as sensitive probes for black hole hair, offering a complementary approach to testing gravity in strong-field regimes.

Abstract: To date, the second-order post-Newtonian (2PN) Hamiltonian has been known in closed analytic form only for systems of up to three point masses. In this paper, we present an analytic expression for the general $N$-body 2PN Hamiltonian in the ADM gauge up to a single integral term that, to our knowledge, has no known closed-form analytic solution. We show that the integrals appearing in the 2PN Hamiltonian can be evaluated numerically to machine precision, allowing for cross-validation against analytical results and enabling the full numerical computation of the $N$-body 2PN Hamiltonian. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical feasibility of the numerical integration of the equations of motion for $N$ bodies at 2PN order using different methods and discuss several strategies for improving computational efficiency.
