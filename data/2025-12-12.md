Abstract: We propose Roman Coronagraph project HLC/575 nm observations of a newly-discovered brown dwarf (HIP 71618 B) from the Subaru/OASIS survey of young accelerating stars, which is supported by NASA headquarters with the directive to identify targets for the Roman Coronagraph that could fulfill TTR5 requirements and be observed during the technology demonstration phase. The target and multiple bright PSF references are within/close to the Roman Continuous Viewing Zone. A high SNR detection of this companion would singlehandedly fulfill TTR5 and would be the first optical detection of a companion at $<$10$^{-6}$ contrast.
  Roman CPP reference star vetting prioritizing stars that can be paired with HIP 71618 would aid the execution of a successful technology demonstration. Additional similar targets may be discovered from OASIS over the next few years that could increase CGI scheduling flexibility and enhance its scientific and technical return. A close collaborative partnership with the CPP team could ensure that they are schedulable.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A plethora of astronomical science cases can only be achieved with high angular resolution observations, and we can expect the number of these to grow as astronomers are constrained by the size limitations of single-aperture space telescopes, making space-based interferometry inevitable. However, the enabling technologies do not have flight heritage at the system level, and the concept remains immature to much of the community, meaning no direct-detection synthetic-aperture space-based interferometer has yet flown and an opportunity exists for the UK to take a world leading role. Here we propose the SPace-based InterFerometry Feasibility (SPIFF) Project as a program to address both issues simultaneously by: 1) completing a thorough survey of the science cases across the EM spectrum that would directly benefit from, or be impossible without, space-based interferometry; 2) down selecting key requirements via a Science Traceability Matrix mapping exercise; 3) host a workshop for the UK astronomical community to consolidate these findings; 4) build a technology demonstration mission to raise TRL and achieve flight heritage of critical technologies. Such a program positions the UK as the partner of choice for any future NASA or ESA space-based interferometry mission, allowing the UK to lead groundbreaking scientific discoveries, while also directly benefiting the UK industrial base by advancing domestic exportable technologies and building direct synergy with other UK space priorities. Indeed, the UK is uniquely positioned to lead in space-based interferometry, possessing a rare trifecta of domestic strengths: world-class expertise in ground-based interferometry and space-based instrumentation; commercial entities developing mission-critical technologies; and scientists whose research spans the full range of science cases that would benefit directly from space-based interferometry.

Abstract: We introduce the Morph approximation, a class of product approximations of probability densities that selects low-order disjoint parameter blocks by maximizing the sum of their total correlations. We use the posterior approximation via Morph as the importance distribution in optimal bridge sampling. We denote this procedure by MorphZ, which serves as a post-processing estimator of the marginal likelihood. The MorphZ estimator requires only posterior samples together with the prior and likelihood, and is fully agnostic to the choice of sampler. We evaluate MorphZ's performance across statistical benchmarks, pulsar timing array (PTA) models, compact binary coalescence (CBC) gravitational-wave (GW) simulations and the GW150914 event. Across these applications, spanning low to high dimensionalities, MorphZ yields accurate evidence at substantially reduced computational cost relative to standard approaches, and can improve these estimates even when posterior coverage is incomplete. Its bridge sampling relative error diagnostic provides conservative uncertainty estimates. Because MorphZ operates directly on posterior draws, it complements exploration-oriented samplers by enabling fast and reliable evidence estimation, while it can be seamlessly integrated into existing inference workflows.

Abstract: Stellar atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances are traditionally determined using template matching techniques based on high-resolution spectra. However, these methods are sensitive to noise and unsuitable for ultra-low-resolution data. Given that the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) will acquire large volumes of ultra-low-resolution spectra, developing effective methods for ultra-low-resolution spectral analysis is crucial. In this work, we investigated the Fully Connected Residual Network (FCResNet) for simultaneously estimating atmospheric parameters ($T_\text{eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H]) and elemental abundances ([C/Fe], [N/Fe], [Mg/Fe]). We trained and evaluated FCResNet using CSST-like spectra (\textit{R} $\sim$ 200) generated by degrading LAMOST spectra (\textit{R} $\sim$ 1,800), with reference labels from APOGEE. FCResNet significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods (KNN, XGBoost, SVR) and CNN in prediction precision. For spectra with g-band signal-to-noise ratio greater than 20, FCResNet achieves precisions of 78 K, 0.15 dex, 0.08 dex, 0.05 dex, 0.10 dex, and 0.05 dex for $T_\text{eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], [C/Fe], [N/Fe] and [Mg/Fe], respectively, on the test set. FCResNet processes one million spectra in only 42 seconds while maintaining a simple architecture with just 348 KB model size. These results suggest that FCResNet is a practical and promising tool for processing the large volume of ultra-low-resolution spectra that will be obtained by CSST in the future.

Abstract: The Near Ultraviolet Transient Explorer (NUTEx) is a CubeSat-based near-ultraviolet (NUV) imaging payload designed for transient sky surveys and is currently under development. CubeSats are compact and cost-effective satellite platforms that have emerged as versatile tools for scientific exploration and technology demonstrations in space. NUTEx is an imaging telescope operating in the 200-300 nm wavelength range, intended for deployment on a micro-satellite bus. The optical system is based on a Ritchey Chretien (RC) telescope configuration, featuring a 146 mm primary mirror. The detector is a photon-counting microchannel plate (MCP) device with a solar-blind photocathode, paired with an in-house developed readout unit. The instrument has a wide field of view (FoV) of 4 deg, a peak effective area of approximately 18 sq cm at 260 nm, and can reach a sensitivity of 21 AB magnitude (SNR = 5) in a 200 second exposure. The primary scientific objective of NUTEx is to monitor the night sky for transient phenomena, such as supernova remnants, flaring M-dwarf stars, and other short-timescale events. The payload is currently scheduled for launch in Q2 2026. This paper presents the NUTEx instrument design, outlines its scientific goals and capabilities, and provides an overview of the electronics and mechanical subsystems, including structural analysis.

Abstract: We present FAST-MEPSA, an optimised version of the MEPSA algorithm developed to detect peaks in uniformly sampled time series affected by uncorrelated Gaussian noise. Although originally conceived for the analysis of gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves (LCs), MEPSA can be readily applied to other transient phenomena. The algorithm scans the input data by applying a set of 39 predefined patterns across multiple timescales. While robust and effective, its computational cost becomes significant at large re-binning factors. To address this, FAST-MEPSA introduces a sparser offset-scanning strategy. In parallel, building on MEPSA's flexibility, we introduce a 40th pattern specifically designed to recover a class of elusive peaks that are typically sub-threshold and lie on the rising edge of broader structures - often missed by the original pattern set. Both versions of FAST-MEPSA - with 39 and 40 patterns - were validated on simulated GRB LCs. Compared to MEPSA, the new implementation achieves a speed-up of nearly a factor 400 at high re-binning factors, with only a minor (~4%) reduction in the number of detected peaks. It retains the same detection efficiency while significantly lowering the false positive rate of low significance. The inclusion of the new pattern increases the recovery of previously undetected and sub-threshold peaks. These improvements make FAST-MEPSA an effective tool for large-scale analyses where a robust trade-off between speed, efficiency, and reliability is essential. The adoption of 40 patterns instead of the classical 39 is advisable when an enhanced efficiency in detecting faint events is desired. The code is made publicly available.

Abstract: Current pulsar timing array (PTA) analyses do not take full advantage of pulsar distance information, thereby missing out on improved angular resolution and on a potential factor-of-two gain in detection sensitivity for individual gravitational-wave (GW) sources. In this work, we investigate the impact of precise pulsar distance measurements on angular resolution as an extension to previous work measuring the angular resolution of a dense, isotropic PTA [Jow et al., 2025]. We present a coherent map-making technique that utilizes precise pulsar distance measurements to reach the diffraction-limited resolution of an individual source: $δθ_{\mathrm{diff}} \sim (1/\mathrm{SNR})(λ_{\mathrm{GW}}/r) \approx 2~\mathrm{arcmin}$, where the SNR refers to the detection strength of the source. With this level of angular resolution, identifying an EM counterpart may become feasible, enabling multi-messenger follow-up. We show that for $\rm SNR=10$, which may be the current sensitivity level using a coherent analysis, the diffraction limit is reached with roughly 9 pulsars. Moreover, angular resolution scales sharply with the number of known pulsar distances as $\sim (1/\mathrm{SNR})^{N_{\mathrm{dist}}/2}$. Thus, each additional pulsar with high signal-to-noise timing and precise distance measurement can improve PTA resolution by an order of magnitude. The distance to the best-timed millisecond pulsar (PSR J0437$-$4715) is already constrained to sub-parsec levels. We argue, therefore, that a coherent analysis of PTA data, fully incorporating pulsar distance information, is timely.

Abstract: Astronomy is the study of the Universe and all the objects that it comprises. Our attention is therefore usually focused beyond Earth, home to the only form of life known today. However, how can we continue to explore the secrets of the Universe, if we stand by and watch our only home burn? We know that there is no Planet B. It is therefore urgent that, as astronomers, we collectively work to protect the Earth, allowing future generations the opportunity to continue to uncover the secrets of the cosmos. As astronomical facilities account for the majority of our community's carbon footprint, we propose guidelines that we hold crucial for the European Southern Observatory (ESO) to consider in the context of the Expanding Horizons programme as it plans a next-generation, transformational facility.

Abstract: Our survey of the fourth $\mathit{Fermi}$ Large Area Telescope catalog (4FGL) unassociated gamma-ray source regions using the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) and Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) aboard the Neil Gehrels $\mathit{Swift}$ Observatory ($\mathit{Swift}$) provides new XRT and UVOT source detections and localizations to help identify potential low-energy counterparts to unassociated $\mathit{Fermi}$ gamma-ray sources. We present a catalog of 218 singlet and 70 multiplet $\mathit{Swift}$ X-ray sources detected within the positional uncertainty ellipses of 244 unassociated $\mathit{Fermi}$ gamma-ray sources from the 4FGL-DR4 catalog, 144 of which are not previously cataloged by Kerby et al. (2021b). For each X-ray source, we derive its X-ray flux and photon index, then use simultaneous UVOT observations with optical survey data to estimate its $V$-band magnitude. We use these parameters as inputs for a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network classifier (NNC) trained to classify sources as blazars, pulsars, or ambiguous gamma-ray sources. For the 213 singlet sources with X-ray and optical data, we classify 173 as likely blazars ($P_\mathrm{bzr} > 0.99$) and 6 as likely pulsars ($P_\mathrm{bzr} < 0.01$), with 34 sources yielding ambiguous results. Including 70 multiplet X-ray sources, we increase the number of $P_\mathrm{bzr} > 0.99$ to 227 and $P_\mathrm{bzr} < 0.01$ to 16. For the subset of these classifications that have been previously studied, a large majority agree with prior classifications, supporting the validity of using this NNC to classify the unknown and newly detected gamma-ray sources.

Abstract: We present FEADME (Fast Elliptical Accretion Disk Modeling Engine), a GPU-accelerated Python framework for modeling broad Balmer-line emission using a relativistic elliptical accretion-disk formalism. Leveraging Jax and NumPyro for differentiable forward modeling and efficient Bayesian inference, FEADME enables large-sample, reproducible analyses of disk-dominated emission-line profiles. We apply the framework to 237 double-peaked emitters (DPEs) from the literature and to five tidal disruption events (TDEs) with disk-like H$α$ emission, fitting three physically motivated model families per spectrum and selecting the preferred model using approximate leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation. We find that AGN exhibit a broad, continuous distribution of disk geometries and kinematics, with significant diversity in disk parameters. Most TDE disk parameter distributions are statistically indistinguishable from those of the AGN, with the sole robust difference being that TDE disks are significantly more circular, consistent with rapid debris circularization in tidal disruption events. The majority of both AGN and TDEs favor models that include both a disk and an additional broad-line component, suggesting that disk emission commonly coexists with more isotropic or wind-driven gas. These results indicate that once a line-emitting disk forms, its spectroscopic appearance is governed by similar physical processes in both persistent AGN and transient TDE accretion flows, and they demonstrate the utility of FEADME for population-level studies of disk structure in galactic nuclei.

Abstract: We present the discovery of EP250827b/SN 2025wkm, an X-ray Flash (XRF) discovered by the Einstein Probe (EP), accompanied by a broad-line Type Ic supernova (SN Ic-BL) at $z = 0.1194$. EP250827b possesses a prompt X-ray luminosity of $\sim 10^{45} \, \rm{erg \, s^{-1}}$, lasts over 1000 seconds, and has a peak energy $E_{\rm{p}} < 1.5$ keV at 90% confidence. SN 2025wkm possesses a double-peaked light curve (LC), though its bolometric luminosity plateaus after its initial peak for $\sim 20$ days, giving evidence that a central engine is injecting additional energy into the explosion. Its spectrum transitions from a blue to red continuum with clear blueshifted Fe II and Si II broad absorption features, allowing for a SN Ic-BL classification. We do not detect any transient radio emission and rule out the existence of an on-axis, energetic jet $\gtrsim 10^{50}~$erg. In the model we invoke, the collapse gives rise to a long-lived magnetar, potentially surrounded by an accretion disk. Magnetically-driven winds from the magnetar and the disk mix together, and break out with a velocity $\sim 0.35c$ from an extended circumstellar medium with radius $\sim 10^{13}$ cm, generating X-ray breakout emission through free-free processes. The disk outflows and magnetar winds power blackbody emission as they cool, producing the first peak in the SN LC. The spin-down luminosity of the magnetar in combination with the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni produces the late-time SN LC. We end by discussing the landscape of XRF-SNe within the context of EP's recent discoveries.

Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio pulses with largely unknown origins, with a subset exhibiting repeating behavior. Magnetars highly magnetized neutron stars and a leading progenitor candidate for FRBs also produce similar but much fainter millisecond radio pulses, suggesting a possible connection between the two phenomena. The irregularity of the time series of repeating FRBs and magnetar pulses may provide insight into the underlying progenitor activity. In this study, we analyze time-series data from three repeating FRB sources (four datasets) and the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 to investigate potential patterns in burst arrival times, energy fluctuations, and peak-frequency shifts. We quantify the degree of randomness (Pincus Index; PI) and chaos (Largest Lyapunov Exponent; LLE) for these three parameters. We find that waiting times across all repeating FRBs exhibit high PI (high randomness) and low LLE (low chaos), consistent with the behavior of magnetar radio pulses. This similarity suggests that both may share a common triggering mechanism. In contrast, the energy fluctuations of both repeating FRBs and magnetar pulses occupy the same region in PI-LLE phase space but display much larger scatter than the other two domains. We discuss the possibility that beaming effects or strong variability in radio-emission efficiency may explain their distinct behavior in the energy domain.

Abstract: The current fleet of X-ray telescopes produces a wealth of multi-dimensional data, allowing us to study sources in time, photon energy and polarization. At the same time, it has become increasingly clear that progress in our physical understanding will only come from studying these sources in multiple dimensions simultaneously. Enabling multi-dimensional studies of X-ray sources requires new theoretical models predicting these data sets, new methods to analyse them and a software framework to combine data, models and methods efficiently. In this paper, we introduce the alpha release of nDspec, a new python-based library designed to allow users to model one- and multi-dimensional datasets common to X-ray astronomy. In the alpha release, we focus on modelling time-averaged data as well as Fourier spectral-timing mode, but highlight how additional dimensions can be added. We discuss design philosophy and current features, and showcase an example use case by characterizing a NICER observation of a black hole X-ray binary. We also highlight current plans for extensions to other dimensions and new features.

Abstract: Both observational and theoretical studies indicate that the central engine of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) is intrinsically time-variable, implying jet inhomogeneity. A jet with an inhomogeneous Lorentz factor distribution develops internal shocks both below and above the photosphere, relaxing toward homologous expansion. Below the photosphere, neutrons, whose mean free paths are much longer than those of charged particles, play an essential role in the dissipation process. Using neutron-inclusive shell simulations with initial conditions based on the collapsar scenario, we link the statistical inhomogeneity of the jet at the breakout of the progenitor to the dissipation that occurs inside and outside the photosphere, and calculate the GeV-TeV neutrino counterpart originated from inelastic neutron-proton interactions consistently with the prompt gamma-ray emission. We find that the peak energy of the GeV-TeV neutrinos is in 10-30 GeV irrespective to the baryon loading factor of the jet, with the high-energy tail extending into the TeV range as the amplitude of the time variability becomes stronger. When gamma-ray emission is efficient as in typical GRBs (i.e., the gamma-ray radiation efficiency with respect to the total jet power is approximately 100%, the radiative efficiency of GeV-TeV neutrinos remains 0.1-10%. By contrast, when the gamma-ray radiation efficiency is relatively low (< 10%) for jets where a large fraction of the energy is dissipated below the photosphere, the neutrino efficiency can increase up to 20%. This suggests that GRBs with relatively low gamma-ray luminosities, as well as X-ray-rich transients, can be promising targets for ongoing and future GeV-TeV neutrino transient searches.

Abstract: Fairall 9 is among the most massive Seyfert galaxies exhibiting a strong soft X-ray excess, but it is challenging to probe soft X-ray reverberation lags (if any) due to the long intrinsic timescales expected from its large black hole mass of $\sim 2.55 \times 10^8 M_\odot$. We fit five XMM-Newton spectra of Fairall 9 using the hybrid reXcor model taking into account both hot and warm corona. The soft excess is explained by a combination of a physically motivated warm corona and the disc reflection. Then, we perform a wavelet coherence analysis of the light curves between 0.3 - 1 and 1 - 4 keV bands. The spectral fits are consistent with a rapidly spinning black hole ($a = 0.99$), a warm corona with optical depth $\sim$10 - 30, and a hot lamp-post corona located at either 5 or $20~r_{\rm g}$. This configuration supports a coexisting hot and warm corona scenario, allowing the disc to extend almost to the event horizon. Our wavelet analysis on combined observations reveals signatures of transient soft X-ray lags, confined to specific time-frequency intervals. The earlier observations exhibit more variable and transient lag behavior. In contrast, the later observations display more persistent soft X-ray lags at the frequencies of $\sim 9\times 10^{-6}$ - $2.5 \times 10^{-5}$ Hz, with amplitudes reaching $\sim$1000 s. The results indicate a progressively stable disc-corona configuration in later observations. Given the mass and geometry of Fairall 9, the observed soft lags appears plausibly consistent in both size and timescales with expectations from X-ray reverberation.

Abstract: We quantify the impact of strong magnetic fields (assuming $B=B_0\cdot r_0^3/r^3$ with $B_0\gtrsim 10^{16}$ G) on the neutrino transport in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Magnetic fields quantize the momenta of electrons and positrons, resulting in an enhanced absorption cross section for low-energy neutrinos and suppressed chemical potentials for $e^\pm$. We include these changes in the M1 scheme for neutrino transport and perform 1-D CCSNe simulations with \texttt{GR1D}. The increased low-energy cross sections reduce the $\barν_e$ mean energy $\langle E_{\barν_e}\rangle$ while elevating the neutrino number luminosities $\mathcal{L_ν}$ for both $ν_e$ and $\barν_e$ due to the lower energy weighted spectra. The reduction of chemical potential enhances the $\barν_e$ emission while suppressing that of $ν_e$, thereby driving an increase in the electron fraction behind the stalled shock at $\sim30$--$100$ km. This further amplifies $\langle E_{ν_e}\rangle$ through an increased electron density. Consequently, magnetic fields amplify $L_{ν_e}$ by increasing both $\mathcal{L}_{ν_e}$ and $\langle E_{ν_e}\rangle$ whereas for $\barν_e$, the rise in $\mathcal{L}_{\barν_e}$ is offset by a decreased $\langle E_{\barν_e}\rangle$, leading to a minimal change in $L_{\barν_e}$. A systematic parameter scan of dipole field configurations suggests that, for $r_0 > 30$ km, $\langle E_{\barν_e} \rangle$ is significantly suppressed and $L_{ν_e}$ is enhanced if $B_0 \geq {2.7} \times 10^{16}$ G. These magnetic effects become negligible for $B_0$ below $\sim {7.4} \times 10^{15}$ G.

Abstract: In this paper, we compute a full set of neutron star magnetosphere structures from the basic vacuum regime to the dissipation-less force-free regime by implementing a resistive prescription for the plasma. A comparison to the radiation reaction limit is also discussed. We investigated the impact of these resistive magnetospheres onto the multi-wavelength emission properties based on the polar cap model for radio wavelengths, on the slot gap model for X-rays and on the striped wind model for $γ$-rays.} % methods heading (mandatory) {We performed time-dependent pseudo-spectral simulations of the full Maxwell equations including a resistive Ohm's law. We deduced the polar cap shape and size, the Poynting flux, the magnetic field structure and the current sheet surface, depending on the magnetic obliquity~$χ$ and on the conductivity~$σ$. We found that the geometry of the magnetosphere close to the stellar surface is not impacted by the amount of resistivity. Polar cap rims remain very similar in shape and size. However the Poynting flux varies significantly as well as the magnetic field sweep-back in the vicinity of the light-cylinder. This bending of field lines reflects into the $γ$-ray pulse profiles, changing the $γ$-ray peak separation~$Δ$ as well as the time lag~$δ$ between the radio pulse and $γ$-ray peaks. X-ray pulse profiles are also drastically affected by the resistivity. A full set of multi-wavelength light-curves can be compiled for future comparison with the third $γ$-ray pulsar catalogue. This systematic study will help to constrain the amount of magnetic energy flowing into particle kinetic energy and shared by radiation.

Abstract: We present various time series analysis methods to analyze multiple-sector observations of bright AGN from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and examine whether issues such as gaps and noise in these data can be mitigated. We determine variability timescales and search for quasi-periodicity using these methods and assess any differences. In this paper, we present an analysis of the $\approx$300-day TESS observation of a blazar 3C 371 using power spectrum density, structure-function, and weighted wavelet Z-transform approaches. To reduce the effect of gaps and noise, Continuous auto-regressive moving averages, Bartlett periodogram, and wavelet decomposition methods are used. We have also used recurrence analysis to account for the nonlinearity present in the data and to quantify variability or periodicity as the recurrent state. Considering the entirety of the TESS observations, we derive the variability timescale to be around 4.5 days. Sector-wise analysis found variability timescales in the range of 3.0--7.0 days, values that are found to be consistent using different methods. When analyzing multiple sectors together, significant variability, which could be quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), of duration 3--6 days in individual segments, is detected. These may be attributed to the kink instabilities developed in the jet or the existence of mini-jets inside a jet undergoing precession. We find that these methods, when applied appropriately, can be used to study the variability in TESS data. The noise present in these TESS observations can be minimized using Bartlett's periodogram and wavelet decomposition to recover the real stochastic variability.

Abstract: Observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs) have already produced tens of strong candidate flares, and their number will greatly increase with upcoming wide field surveys. Nevertheless, the origin of the measured luminosity peak at early times is still unknown, and the ultimate sources of energy dissipation in TDEs are not fully understood. Here we present the first three-dimensional end-to-end simulation of a TDE by a $10^{4}M_\odot$ intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) with realistic parameters, run with the radiation-hydrodynamics code RICH. We find that the stellar debris fails to circularize efficiently, while a low-density, radiation-driven wind forms near pericenter and expands quasi-spherically. Radiation is advected by this outflow and released at the photosphere, which expands to radii of $\approx10^{13}$ cm and reaches temperatures of ~few $10^{4}$K at the peak of the light curve. The resulting luminosity briefly exceeds the Eddington limit before settling near that value. We systematically test the numerical convergence of our simulation by running it at three resolutions. While the nozzle shock at pericenter may be under-resolved, we find that global results are qualitatively converged and, largely, quantitatively robust. The upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory's LSST (g and r band) and ULTRASAT (near UV) will be able to observe events like our simulated IMBH TDE up to redshifts of z$\approx$0.1 and z$\approx$0.06, respectively.

Abstract: We perform population synthesis modeling of isolated neutron stars in the Milky Way over its lifetime. Compared with previous studies, we use more detailed models of the interstellar medium and the magneto-rotational evolution of neutron stars. We demonstrate that presently, the spin-down rate at the propeller stage is the main uncertain factor that influences the number of accreting isolated neutron stars. If the propeller stage duration allows neutron stars to begin accreting matter from the interstellar medium and if the efficiency of accretion is high, then the number of accreting isolated neutron stars in eROSITA data can reach ~a few thousand. Still, uncertainties in spin-down at the propeller stage and in the accretion process can drastically decrease this number. We suggest that future observations of neutron stars in wide low-mass binaries recently discovered by Gaia can clarify these issues.

Abstract: The discovery of joint sources of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves has been a primary target for the LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and IceCube observatories. The joint detection of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves would provide insight into cosmic processes, such as progenitor dynamics and outflows. The joint detection of multiple cosmic messengers can also elevate the significance of the observation when some or all of the constituent messengers are sub-threshold, not significant enough to declare their detection individually. Leveraging data from the LIGO, Virgo, and IceCube observatories, we conducted an archival investigation of sub-threshold multimessenger events. Complementing previous analyses, we used minimal assumptions to search for common sources of sub-threshold gravitational-wave and high-energy neutrino candidates during the third observing run (O3) of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Our search did not identify significant joint sources. We therefore derive constraints on the rate density of joint sources for each compact binary merger population as a function of the energy emitted in neutrinos. Only a fraction of the gravitational-wave sources emit neutrinos, if the neutrino emission has high bolometric energy ($>10^{52}$ to $10^{54}$ erg).

Abstract: Upcoming space-based gravitational wave detectors such as LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, will be sensitive to extreme- and intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs and IMRIs). These binaries are comprised of a supermassive black hole and a stellar-mass object or intermediate-mass black hole. Their detection will probe the structure of galactic nuclei and enable tests of general relativity. As these events will be observed over thousands of orbital cycles, they will be extremely sensitive to both the underlying spacetime and astrophysical environment, demanding exquisite theoretical models on both fronts to avoid biased or even erroneous results. In particular, many (E/)IMRIs are expected to occur within accretion discs around supermassive black holes, and the nonlinearities present when modeling these systems require numerical simulations. In preparation for future modeling of LISA sources, we have conducted a comparison between eight different hydrodynamical codes and applied them to the problem of a q = 10^{-4} mass ratio binary interacting with an accretion disc. Thicker discs appear more lenient, and all codes at sufficiently high resolutions are in good agreement with each other and analytical predictions. For thinner discs, beyond the reach of analytical models, we find substantial disagreement between 2D and 3D simulations and between different codes, including both the magnitude and sign of the torque. With time and energy efficiency in mind, codes that leverage moving meshes or grid-based Lagrangian remapping seem preferable, as do codes that can leverage graphical processing units and other energy-efficient hardware.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Rotating black holes with strong magnetic fields lead to an outward energy flux in the form of jets governed by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. These jets depend on factors such as accretion rate, magnetic flux and the spin of the black hole. When such rotating black holes get attached to a cosmic string, it leads to a further rotational energy extraction, leading to a reduced spin. We consider such a system and investigate the effect this reduced spin has on the jet power and its dependence on the cosmic string tension, $μ$. It is shown that for a constant magnetic flux and accretion rate, the jet energy flux is inversely proportional to $μ^2$. Interestingly, the rate of this energy flux varies with time and is again dependent on $μ$. We also study the total angular momentum evolution of the black hole by considering four major effects: accretion, jets, cosmic string energy extraction and the Bardeen-Petterson effect. Further, we attempt to analyse the condition for the spin-down of a black hole due to these effects and find out that it is possible for both small and large string tensions, with a higher possibility for larger string tensions. Another interesting phenomenon that has been proposed is the alignment of the jet with the cosmic string. Additionally, the Bardeen-Petterson effect also leads to alignment or misalignment of the inner and outer disks depending on the alignment of the string. In this manuscript we propose that these results might have an observable effect and hence could serve as a potential detection method for cosmic strings.

Abstract: We study the prospects of the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA), a proposed deci-Hz GW detector, to observe binary black holes (BBHs) and enable multiband science with ground-based detectors. We assess the detectability of the events observed by current instruments up to the GWTC-4.0 data release, and of simulated populations consistent with the latest reconstruction by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. We find that LGWA alone would have been able to observe more than one third of the events detected so far, and that it could detect $\sim\!90$ events merging in the ground-based band per year out to redshifts $z\sim3-5$. Current detectors at design sensitivity and 100% duty cycle could detect thousands of BBHs per year, with one to a few hundred multiband counterparts in LGWA. Third-generation (3G) detectors can observe most of the BBHs detected by LGWA merging in their frequency band in the simulated mass range $7\,{\rm M}_\odot\lesssim M_{\rm tot}\lesssim 600\,{\rm M}_\odot$, enabling systematic joint analyses of hundreds of events. The short time to merger from the deci-Hz band to the Hz-kHz band (typically months to a year) allows for early warning, targeted follow-up, and archival searches. Multiband observations of intermediate-mass BBHs in the deci-Hz band are particularly promising. We perform an injection study for a GW231123-like system (the most massive BBH detection to date, which accumulates $\sim 10^5$ inspiral cycles in LGWA) and show that deci-Hz observations can measure the chirp mass even better than 3G instruments and yield good sky localization and inclination measurement, even with a single observatory. Opening the deci-Hz band would substantially improve the prospects of GW astronomy for intermediate-mass BBHs.

Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the importance of a fully relativistic treatment of the dephasing of gravitational waves induced by dark-matter overdensities in extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). However, a general-relativistic description of the dark matter phase-space distribution is currently available only for the case of a dark matter "spike" arising from adiabatic black hole growth. Here we develop a fully general-relativistic formalism for the more realistic scenario in which a supermassive stellar progenitor collapses to a black hole and produces a shallower dark matter overdensity, or "mound". We follow self-consistently the evolution of the supermassive star, its collapse, and the subsequent growth of the resulting black hole, together with the collisionless dark matter orbits. We find that in the regime where the collapse becomes non-adiabatic, the dark matter distribution function is significantly reshaped, with a clear depletion in the low-binding-energy region of phase space. Our results provide a more realistic prediction for the dark matter phase-space distribution around supermassive black holes, which is an essential step in our programme to use future EMRI observations to extract information about both the nature of dark matter and the formation history of the black hole.

Abstract: An extremal Reissner-Nordström black hole can form in finite time in the gravitational collapse of a massless charged scalar field. The proof of this is based on the method of characteristic gluing, which involves making an Ansatz for the scalar field at the horizon. We perform a numerical investigation of the characteristic gluing procedure for several different Ansätze. In each case, gluing is possible only if the final black hole mass is large enough. We find that the minimum required mass varies significantly for different Ansätze. We also consider the effect of including a mass term for the scalar field. In this case, for each Ansatz we determine the maximum mass-to-charge ratio for the scalar field such that gluing is possible. Analogous results are obtained for a non-zero cosmological constant.

Abstract: Observing gravitational waves from sub-solar-mass, inspiraling compact binaries would provide almost smoking-gun evidence for primordial black holes. Here, we develop a method to search for ultra-compact binaries with chirp masses ranging from $[10^{-2},10^{-1}]M_\odot$. This mass range represents a previously unexplored gap in gravitational-wave searches for compact binaries: it was thought that the signals would too long for matched-filtering analyses but too short for time-frequency pattern-recognition techniques. Despite this, we show that a pattern-recognition technique, the Generalized frequency-Hough (GFH), can be employed with particular modifications that allow us to handle rapidly spinning-up binaries and to increase the statistical robustness of our method, and call this improved method BinaryGFH-v2. We then design a hypothetical search for binaries in this mass regime, compare the empirical and theoretical sensitivities of this method, and project constraints on formation rate densities and the fraction of dark matter that primordial black holes could compose in both current- and future-generation gravitational-wave detectors. Our results show that our method can be used to search for sub-solar-mass, ultra-compact objects in a mass regime that remains to-date unconstrained with gravitational waves.

Abstract: We construct solitonic Hayward-boson stars (SHBSs) in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, which consists of the Einstein-Hayward model and a complex scalar field with a soliton potential. Our results reveal a critical magnetic charge $q_c$. For $q\geq q_c$ in the limit of $ω\rightarrow 0$, the matter field is primarily distributed within the critical radius $r_c$, beyond which it decays rapidly, while the metric components $-g_{tt}$ and $1/g_{rr}$ become very small at $r_c$. These solutions are termed ``frozen solitonic Hayward-boson stars" (FSHBSs). Continuously decreasing $Λ$ disrupts the frozen state. However, we did not find a frozen solution when $q<q_c$. The value of $q_c$ depends both on the cosmological constant $Λ$ and the self-interaction coupling $η$. We also found that for high frequency solutions, increasing $η$ can yield a pure Hayward solution. However, for low frequency solutions, increasing $η$ reduces both $1/g_{rr}$ and $-g_{tt}$. Furthermore, we analyzed the effective potential of SHBSs and identified an extra pair of light rings in the second solution branch.

Abstract: We prove an intrinsic analogue of Hawking's rigidity theorem for extremal horizons in arbitrary dimensions: any compact cross-section of a rotating extremal horizon in a spacetime satisfying the null energy condition must admit a Killing vector field. If the dominant energy condition is satisfied for null vectors, it follows that an extension of the near-horizon geometry admits an enhanced isometry group containing $SO(2,1)$ or the 2D Poincaré group $\mathbb{R}^2 \rtimes SO(1,1)$. In the latter case, the associated Aretakis instability for a massless scalar field is shifted by one order in the derivatives of the field transverse to the horizon. We consider a broad class of examples including Einstein-Maxwell(-Chern-Simons) theory and Yang-Mills theory coupled to charged matter. In these examples we show that the symmetries are inherited by the matter fields.

Abstract: We revisit Yeom's annihilation-to-nothing scenario using a modified Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation, incorporating higher curvature corrections. By taking these corrections into account, we show that singularity resolution does not occur within low-energy effective field theory (EFT). Since general relativity (GR) is itself only a low-energy EFT of an underlying ultraviolet (UV) theory, it is unlikely that true singularity resolution can emerge within its domain of validity. Our analysis does not contradict Yeom's conjecture but clarifies that any true resolution of the black hole singularity necessarily requires the inclusion of UV degrees of freedom beyond the scope of GR.

Abstract: The final equilibrium stage of stellar evolution can result in either a black hole or a compact object such as a white dwarf or neutron star. In general relativity, both stationary black holes and stationary stellar configurations are known to be axisymmetric, and black hole rigidity has been extended to several higher curvature modifications of gravity. In contrast, no comparable result had previously been established for stationary stars beyond general relativity. In this work we extend the stellar axisymmetry theorem to a broad class of diffeomorphism invariant metric theories. Assuming asymptotic flatness and standard smoothness requirements, we show that the Killing symmetry implied by thermodynamic equilibrium inside the star uniquely extends to the exterior region, thereby enforcing rotational invariance. This demonstrates that axisymmetry of stationary stellar configurations is not a feature peculiar to Einstein gravity but a universal property of generally covariant gravitational theories, persisting even in the presence of higher curvature corrections.

In this work we exhibit a single model that interpolates between the two regimes.

Abstract: Spacetimes with an ergoregion that is not connected to a horizon are linearly unstable. While the linear regime has been studied in a number of settings, little is known about the nonlinear evolution of this ergoregion instability. Here, we investigate this by numerically evolving the unstable growth of a massless vector field in a rapidly spinning boson star in full general relativity. We find that the backreaction of the instability causes the star to become more gravitationally bound, accelerating the growth, and eventually leading to black hole formation. During the nonlinear growth phase, small scale features develop in the unstable mode and emitted radiation as nonlinear gravitational interactions mediate a direct turbulent cascade. The gravitational wave signal exhibits bursts, akin to so-called gravitational wave echoes, with increasing amplitude towards black hole formation.

Abstract: We analyze a cosmological solution to the field equations of a modified gravity model where curvature and matter are nonminimally coupled. The current Universe's accelerated expansion is driven by a cosmological constant while the impact of the nonminimal coupling on the expansion history is recast as an effective equation of state for evolving dark energy. The model is analyzed under a tracking solution that follows the minimum of the effective potential for a scalar field that captures the modified theory's effects. We determine the conditions for the existence of this minimum and for the validity of the tracking solution. Cosmological constraints on the parameters of the model are obtained by resorting to recent outcomes of data from the DESI collaboration in combination with the Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey supernovae compilations, which give compatible results that point to the presence of a dynamical behavior for dark energy. The gravity model violates the equivalence principle since it gives rise to a fifth force that implies the Earth and Moon fall differently towards the Sun. The cosmological constraints are intersected with limits resulting from a test of the equivalence principle in the Earth-Moon system based on lunar laser ranging data. We find that a variety of model parameters are consistent with both of these constraints, all while producing a dynamical evolution of dark energy with similarities to that found in recent DESI results.

Abstract: The analysis examines how neutrinos behave when their trajectories unfold around a black hole sourced by a Kalb-Ramond field, where spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking reshapes the surrounding geometry. Instead of following the conventional order, the study focuses first on the observable consequences: alterations in the neutrino-antineutrino annihilation energy output, shifts in the oscillation phase accumulated along the path, and distortions in flavor conversion probabilities induced by gravitational lensing. These features are then tied to the Lorentz-violating spacetime structure, which governs the propagation of the neutrinos. Numerical simulations are carried out for both two- and three-flavor descriptions, with normal and inverted mass orderings.

Abstract: The astrophysical foreground from compact-binary coalescence signals is expected to be a dominant part of total gravitational wave (GW) energy density in the frequency band of the third-generation detectors. The detection of any other subdominant stochastic GW background (GWB), especially a primordial GWB, will be disturbed by the astrophysical foreground, which needs to be cleaned for further studies of other stochastic GWB. Although previous studies have proposed several cleaning methods, the foreground from subthreshold binary neutron stars (BNS) has been a major obstacle to remove. In this paper, we propose the novel idea to acquire better estimation of the unresolved foreground, by using the information about its anisotropies. We simulate the BNS population and compute its angular power spectrum and shot noise. We find that the shot noise from BNS is too faint to observe after subtracting loud signals due to the limited angular resolution of the third-generation detectors. This justifies the approximation regarding the unresolved foreground as an isotropic component. We also discuss the angular resolution necessary to make our method valid for the foreground subtraction.

Abstract: Recent efforts have shown that Kantowski-Sachs spacetime provides a useful framework for analyzing perturbations inside a Schwarzschild black hole (BH). In these studies, the adoption of a Hamiltonian formulation offers an insightful perspective. The aim of this work is twofold. First, we revisit and elaborate the results obtained so far in Kantowski-Sachs, with the focus placed on axial perturbations. In particular, by exploiting the relation between this spacetime and the interior of a nonrotating BH, we consider the extension of those results to the exterior geometry of the BH. In this way, we clarify the relation between the axial perturbative gauge invariants emerging from the canonical analysis and the already well-established axial BH invariants, often referred to as master functions. We do so by providing a unified picture of the Hamiltonian formalism, which does not distinguish, formally, between exterior and interior geometries. The second objective is to explore the role of Darboux transformations, which were found as hidden symmetries in the context of BH perturbations, and their appearance in the Hamiltonian setting. Within this framework, the Hamiltonian formulation provides a clear geometric interpretation and characterization of Darboux transformations within the axial sector, viewing them as the set of canonical transformations between Hamiltonians for axial master functions.

Abstract: Master functions of black holes are fundamental tools in gravitational-wave physics and are typically derived within a Lagrangian framework. Starting from the Kantowski-Sachs geometry, one can instead construct a perturbative Hamiltonian description for the interior region of an uncharged and nonrotating black hole. This approach provides a complementary perspective and enables a quantum treatment of the background geometry and its perturbations. In this work, we extend the application of this formulation to the exterior region and establish a correspondence between the perturbative invariants of the canonical approach and the master functions commonly used in black hole analyses. Once a consistent Hamiltonian description for their canonical counterparts is obtained, a hybrid quantization of the master functions follows naturally.

Abstract: In a previous paper [9], we proved the following singularity theorem applicable to cosmological models with a positive cosmological constant: if a four-dimensional spacetime satisfying the null energy condition contains a compact Cauchy surface which is expanding in all directions, then the spacetime is past null geodesically incomplete unless the Cauchy surface is topologically a spherical space. The proof in [9] made use of the positive resolution of the surface subgroup conjecture [15]. In this note, we demonstrate how the less-broadly-known positive resolution of the virtual positive first Betti number conjecture [1] provides a more streamlined and unified approach to the proof. We illustrate the theorem with some examples and analyze its rigidity under null geodesic completeness.

Abstract: We study the backreaction of quantum fields in the Boulware vacuum state on the Schwarzschild geometry, using the Riegert--Mottola--Vaulin renormalized stress-energy tensor derived from the conformal anomaly. An order-reduction procedure is applied to the first order, paying special attention to the conservation of the resulting stress-energy tensor. The results obtained in these different situations are compared between them, and also to recent works in the literature using other approximations for the renormalized stress-energy tensor.

Abstract: In recent years, pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have reported evidence for a nanohertz gravitational-wave (GW) background. As radio telescope sensitivity improves, PTAs are also expected to detect continuous gravitational waves from individual supermassive black hole binaries. Nanohertz GWs generate both Earth and pulsar terms in the timing data, and the time delay between the two terms encodes the pulsar distance. Precise pulsar distance measurements are critical to fully exploiting pulsar-term information, which can improve the measurement precision of GW sources' sky position parameters and thus enhance the GW sky-localization capability. In this work, we propose a new pulsar distance estimation method by using pulsar-term phase information from GWs. We construct two-dimensional distance posteriors for pulsar pairs based on the simulated GW signals and combine them to constrain individual pulsar distances. Compared with the existing one-dimensional method, our approach reduces the impact of source-parameter uncertainties on pulsar distance measurements. Considering four GW sources and a PTA of 20 pulsars with a white-noise level of 20 ns, we find that a significant fraction of pulsars at distances $\lesssim 1.4$ kpc can achieve sub-parsec distance precision over a 15-year observation.

Abstract: The neutron star -- black hole (NSBH) binary GW200105 was recently found to have significant residual orbital eccentricity at a gravitational-wave frequency of 20 Hz~\cite{Morras:2025xfu}. The event was originally identified with moderate significance by matched-filter searches that employ non-eccentric templates. The neglect of relevant physical effects, such as orbital eccentricity, can severely reduce the sensitivity of the search and, consequently, also the significance of an event candidate. Here, we present a targeted eccentric search for GW200105. The eccentric search identifies GW200105 as the most significant event with a signal-to-noise ratio of $13.4$ and a false alarm rate of less than 1 in 1000 years.
  The best-matching template parameters are consistent with the Bayesian inference result, supporting the interpretation of GW200105 as an NSBH that formed through dynamical mechanisms and not isolated binary evolution.

Abstract: In this work, we will explore the effects of F(R) theories in the classical scheme using the anisotropic Bianchi Type I cosmological model with standard matter employing a barotropic fluid with equation of state $P=γρ$. In this work we present the classical solutions in two gauge, N=1 and $N=6ABCD=6η^3D$ obtaining some results that are usually used as ansatz to solve the Einstein field equation. For completeness, we present the solutions in vacuum as well.

Abstract: Gravitational-wave observations of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in vacuum are largely insensitive to the internal structure of the small compact companion. We show that this conclusion can change when the central black hole is surrounded by a dense dark matter environment. We compute, for the first time, the relativistic dynamical-friction force on a neutron star moving through a collisionless medium and its impact on the evolution of EMRIs embedded in dense dark matter spikes. We then perform a Bayesian parameter-estimation analysis of simulated LISA observations to assess the measurability of both spike properties and the companion's internal structure. We find that, in our fiducial dark matter spike models, EMRIs with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $\gtrsim 20$ already allow us to distinguish neutron star from black hole companions, while events with SNR $\gtrsim 400$ make it possible to discriminate between different neutron star equations of state.

Abstract: We study the quantum version of the classical twin paradox in special relativity by replacing the twins with quantum detectors, and studying the transitions and entanglement induced by coupling them to a quantum field. We show that the \textit{changes} in direction of acceleration leave imprints on detector responses and entanglement, inducing novel features which might have relevance in black hole spacetimes.
