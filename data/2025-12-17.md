Abstract: The eponymous BL Lac object BL Lacertae is one of the most well-monitored active galactic nuclei, frequently observed from radio to gamma rays. Its relatively soft $γ$-ray spectrum peaks near 500~MeV, and since 2020 it has undergone an exceptional series of flaring episodes. The observed emission is well described by synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) models, with negligible contribution from external seed photons. We investigate the physical origin of BL~Lacertae's $γ$-ray temporal and spectral variability using data from the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the \textit{Fermi} Gamma-ray Space Telescope, and show that this variability can be explained by a single varying parameter, namely the electrons' peak energy, $γ_p$, under a single-zone SSC scenario with a log-parabolic electron distribution. We use a Markov chain Monte Carlo to estimate the spectral parameters of BL Lacertae over time, selected from an adaptive-binned gamma-ray light curve. We then study the correlation between the inverse Compton peak luminosity, $L_{IC}$, and the position of this peak on the SED energy axis, $E_p$, and compare it with what is expected for a single-zone SSC scenario when only one parameter is free to vary. We find a correlation $L_{IC} = 10^{42.33\pm0.15\pm0.18_{sys}}E_p^{0.98\pm0.05\pm0.06_{sys}}$, consistent, within the errors, with the linear relation $L_{\mathrm{IC}} \propto E_p$, expected when $γ_p$ is the only free parameter in the assumed SSC model. This result supports a minimalist SSC scenario in which changes in $γ_p$ dominate the observed temporal and spectral variability of BL~Lacertae.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Appearing as secondary higher-velocity absorption components, high-velocity features (HVFs) have been observed in several absorption lines in many Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The frequency and ubiquity of these components in silicon and calcium features specifically indicates that the mechanism through which they form must be common occurrence among the majority of SNe Ia. Here we present modelling of the HVF evolution in a sample of six well observed SNe Ia with the radiative-transfer code tardis. A base model is derived for each of the SNe to reproduce the photospheric velocity components, followed by a grid of simulations with Gaussian enhancements to the density profile at high velocities. We train a set of neural networks to emulate the impact of these density enhancements upon the simulated silicon line profile. These networks are subsequently used within a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework to infer the density enhancement parameters that most closely reproduce the HVF evolution. While we obtain good matches for the silicon profile, we find that a single density enhancement alone cannot simultaneously produce the observed silicon and calcium HVF evolution. Our findings indicate that neither the delayed-detonation mechanism, nor the double-detonation mechanism can produce these HVFs, suggesting that something may be missing from the models.

Abstract: Searches for the putative large-scale X-ray halo around the Geminga pulsar have been extensively performed using various narrow field-of-view X-ray telescopes. In this paper, we present wide-field scanning observation of Geminga with SRG/ART-XC. Our X-ray analysis provides, for the first time, direct imaging of a $3.5^\circ \times 3.5^\circ$ region in the $4-12$ keV energy band, comparable in extent to the expected Geminga emission. The ART-XC observation provides a highly uniform sky coverage without strong vignetting effects. The synchrotron X-ray halo flux was predicted using a physical model based on particle injection, diffusion, and cooling over the pulsar's lifetime, as well as the spectral and spatial properties of the synchrotron X-ray and inverse-Compton gamma-ray emissions. The model is tuned to reproduce existing multiwavelength data from X-ray upper limits and GeV to TeV gamma-ray observations. After accounting for the high particle background and its uncertainties, no significant emission is found in the assumed source region, and X-ray flux upper limits are derived. These limits are less constraining by up to a factor of three with respect to existing results obtained with narrow field-of-view telescopes and longer exposure times. Nonetheless, we place direct and independent constraints on Geminga's ambient magnetic field strength, which are compatible with other studies. Our methodology, including simulation for longer observation times, is applied for the first time to the wide field-of-view search for pulsar halos. Using extensive simulations, we also show that a 68% probability of detecting the Geminga pulsar halo can be achieved with a 20-day SRG/ART-XC exposure for a 3 $μG$ magnetic field.

Abstract: Context. Numerous classical novae have been observed to emit γ-rays (E > 100 MeV) detected by the Fermi-LAT. The prevailing hypothesis attributes this emission to the interaction of accelerated particles within shocks in the nova ejecta. However, the lack of non-thermal X-ray detection coincident with the γ-rays remains a challenge to this theory. Methods. We performed similar analyses of the Fermi-LAT data for both novae to determine the duration, localization, and spectral properties of the γ-ray emission. These results were compared with optical data from the AAVSO database and X-ray observations from NuSTAR, available for V1723 Sco 2024 only, to infer the nature of the accelerated particles. Finally, we used a physical emission model to extract key parameters related to particle acceleration. Results. V1723 Sco 2024 was found to be a very bright γ-ray source with an emission duration of 15 days allowing us to constrain the spectral index and the total energy of accelerated protons. Despite early NuSTAR observations, no non-thermal X-ray emission was detected simultaneously with the γ-rays. However, unexpected γ-ray and thermal hard X-ray emission were observed more than 40 days after the nova outburst, suggesting that particle acceleration can occur even several weeks post-eruption. V6598 Sgr 2023, on the other hand, was detected by the Fermi-LAT at a significance level of 4σover just two days, one of the shortest γ-ray emission durations ever recorded, coinciding with a rapid decline in optical brightness. Finally, the high ratio of γ-ray to optical luminosities and γ-ray to X-ray luminosities for both novae, as well as the curvature of the γ-ray spectrum of V1723 Sco below 500 MeV, are all more consistent with the hadronic than the leptonic scenario for γ-ray generation in novae.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: One of the distinctive properties of magnetars, young neutron stars powered mainly by magnetic energy, is the emission of short ($\lesssim$1 s) bursts of hard X-rays. Such bursts have been observed in nearly all the known magnetars, although at different and time-variable rates of occurrence. In the last two decades, the INTEGRAL satellite has extensively covered with good imaging capabilities the Galactic plane, where most magnetars reside. We present the results of a comprehensive search for magnetar bursts in more than twenty years of archival data of the INTEGRAL IBIS instrument (15 keV - 1 MeV). This led to the detection of 1349 bursts with 30-150 keV fluence in the $\sim2\times10^{-9} - 3\times10^{-6}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ range from 21 of the 34 examined magnetars and candidate magnetars with well known positions. The durations of the bursts, in terms of $T_{90}$, follow a lognormal distribution centered at $\sim0.1$ s. Most of the detected bursts originated from three particularly active sources: 1E 1547-5408, SGR 1806-20, and SGR 1935+2154. The integral distributions of their burst fluences follow power laws with slopes $β$= 0.76$\pm$0.04, 0.95$\pm$0.06, and 0.92$\pm$0.10, respectively. The burst spectra are generally well fit with an exponentially cut-off power law with peak energy $E_{peak}$ in the range $\sim20-60$ keV for SGR 1806-20 and SGR 1935+2154, while the bursts of 1E 1547-5408 are slightly harder ($E_{peak}\sim35-100$ keV). A significant anti-correlation between $E_{peak}$ and fluence is found for SGR 1806-20, which provided the largest number of bursts among the sources of our sample.

Abstract: Blazars, a subclass of radio-loud active galactic nuclei with relativistic jets aligned close to our line of sight, emit highly variable non-thermal radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum. The physical origin of their emission and the blazar sequence remain open questions. We present a self-consistent two-zone leptonic model in which relativistic electrons accelerate in a compact region, losing energy via synchrotron and inverse Compton processes, and escape into a larger zone permeated by an external photon field associated with magnetohydrodynamic winds from the accretion disk. By varying only the mass accretion rate onto the central black hole, the model naturally reproduces the blazar sequence, including Compton Dominance, $γ$-ray spectral indices, and the positions of synchrotron and inverse Compton peaks, while variations in secondary parameters account for the observed spread in the data. Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars exhibit strong external Compton emission from the extended zone, whereas BL Lac objects are dominated by synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission from the compact acceleration region. This framework highlights the key role of accretion rate and spatially structured emission zones in shaping blazar spectra and provides a unified interpretation of their diverse phenomenology.

Abstract: Extensive air showers produced by the interaction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays ($E > 10^{18}$ eV) in the Earth's atmosphere provide a challenging yet unique channel to probe hadronic interactions at the 100 TeV center-of-mass energy scale. Over more than 20 years of operation, the Pierre Auger Observatory has delivered invaluable insights into the modeling of hadronic interactions at energies beyond human-made particle accelerators. Notably, predictions from current models of hadronic interactions yield a muon deficit that becomes more pronounced with energy when compared to measurements. Presently, the interpretation of the nuclear mass composition estimated from the muon content is in tension with that from direct measurements of the depth of the maximum of electromagnetic profiles. Yet, the measured fluctuations of the muon content of air showers are in agreement with model predictions. These findings hint at small deviations in hadronic models that accumulate throughout the whole shower development rather than at large errors in the calculation of the first hadronic interactions. Also, in an independent, data-driven analysis, we show that the muon deficit can be alleviated if we allow a shift of the predicted depth of the maximum of air-shower profiles by 30 -50 g cm$^{-2}$ towards a heavier mass composition. More recently, we have also provided an updated measurement of the proton-proton cross-section at a center-of-mass energy of 57 TeV and the first estimates of the neutron content of air showers by exploiting late-time signals from the surface scintillator detectors of AugerPrime, the present upgrade of the Observatory. With the advent of AugerPrime, we expect to deliver breakthrough results on the 100 TeV-scale hadronic interactions in the next decade.

Abstract: We investigate how deviations from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy modify black-hole spacetimes through the recently proposed entropy-geometry correspondence. For four representative modified entropies, namely Barrow, Rényi, Kaniadakis, and logarithmic, we derive the corresponding effective metrics and analyze their thermodynamic and topological classification using the off-shell free energy and winding numbers. We show that Barrow and Rényi entropies yield a single unstable sector with global charge $W=-1$, while logarithmic and Kaniadakis corrections produce canceling defects with $W=0$, revealing topological structures absent in the Schwarzschild case. Using the modified metrics, we further calculate the photon-sphere radius and shadow size, showing that each modified entropy relation induces characteristic optical shifts. Thus, by comparing with Event Horizon Telescope observations of Sgr A$^\ast$, we extract new bounds on all entropy-deformation parameters. Our results demonstrate that thermodynamic topology, together with photon-sphere phenomenology, offers a viable way to test generalized entropy frameworks and probe departures from the Bekenstein-Hawking area law.

Abstract: The AdS vacuum corresponds to a negative cosmological constant $Λ$. While it is well-motivated theoretically, There has always been controversy over its actual existence. The AdS-dS transition is corresponding to a sign switching $Λ$. We have proposed an ansatz for a negative time-varying cosmological constant $Λ(H)$ as a function of Hubble parameter $H$, and used it in constructing a periodic model with no future singularity in a scale-invariance gravity. With the proposed Ansatz for negative $Λ$, The model leads to a physically acceptable cosmic description, while we get unphysical parameters with the positive and zero values of $Λ$. The model reveals a Quintom behavior with a sign flipping of cosmic pressure during each period. The non-conventional mechanism of negative $Λ$ that are expected to address the late-time acceleration has been revisited.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Traditionally, the embedding procedure for spherically symmetric spacetimes has been restricted to the equatorial plane $θ= π/2$. This conventional approach, however, encounters a fundamental limitation: not every spherically symmetric geometry admits an isometric embedding of its equatorial slice into three-dimensional Euclidean space. When such embeddings are not possible, the standard geometric intuition becomes inapplicable. In this work, we generalize the embedding procedure to slices with arbitrary polar angles $θ\neq π/2$, thereby extending the visualization and analysis of spacetimes beyond the reach of traditional methods.
  The formalism is applied to Schwarzschild-like wormholes and to a generalized Minkowski spacetime with angular deficit or excess, which are particularly relevant since their equatorial slices cannot be consistently embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$. In these cases, we identify the explicit constraints on the radial coordinate, polar angle, and geometric parameters required to guarantee consistent embeddings into three-dimensional Euclidean space.

Abstract: We construct the exact stellar configurations that contain an ordinary perfect-fluid matter that interacts minimally with a condensate of gravitons with distinct pressure conditions on the surface. We propose vanishing transverse pressure on the surface for, namely graviton condensate type 1 and vanishing radial pressure on the surface for type 2. The condition for the radial pressure of type 1 requires the existence of a thin shell that will balance the pressure discontinuity while for type 2, the discontinuity on transverse pressure does not require the additional thin shell. It is found that the Buchdahl inequality of the resulting stellar configurations depends on the parameter related to the graviton condensate, such that we can find the ultra-compact regime of the stellar models. Moreover, the echo time and echo frequency within the ultra-compact regime are computed. At the same compactness, it is found that the presence of the graviton condensate will delay the gravitational echoes for type 2 and will expedite the gravitational echoes for type 1 compared to constant density star, $τ_{echo2}>τ_{CDS}>τ_{echo1}$. Furthermore, the gravitational perturbation of a massless scalar wave is also investigated to support these results. These results could open more opportunities for the observational study of graviton in the near future, mostly from the compact astrophysical objects.

Abstract: The first-order out of equilibrium correction to the distribution function, obtained by implementing the projection method for the perturbed relativistic Boltzmann equation using the Chapman-Enskog method, is generalized in order to explicitly include the freedom of choice for thermodynamic frame and representation. It is shown how this procedure leads to general constitutive equations that couple the thermodynamic fluxes to all forces including a weak external electromagnetic field. Special cases of the resulting force-flux relations have been shown to lead to physically sound theories for relativistic fluids.

Abstract: We study the scattering of gravitational waves by axion domain walls in teleparallel gravity with the Nieh-Yan term. Since a domain wall causes the parity violation, the transmitted gravitational waves also exhibit the parity violation. We calculate the degree of circular polarization of gravitational waves. It turns out that gravitational waves after going through the domain wall could be chiral. Remarkably, the degree of circular polarization does not depend on the tension of the domain wall.

Abstract: Quantum-gravitational effective actions with higher-derivative and non-local operators are expected to regularize the singularities of general relativity. Here we focus on quasi-local Einstein-Weyl gravity and obtain a classification of Frobenius solutions in static spherical symmetry. In contrast to local Einstein-Weyl gravity, and more generally quadratic gravity, we find that the quasi-local theory admits only regular solutions at the radial core. In addition, we find asymptotic $1/r^{6}$-corrections to the Schwarzschild geometry at large radial distances. Other solution classes around generic expansion points describe Schwarzschild-like and other types of horizons, as well as symmetric and non-symmetric wormhole throats.

Abstract: Binary black hole mergers with asymmetric component masses are key targets for both third-generation ground-based and future space-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, offering unique access to the strong-field dynamics of gravity. The evolution is commonly divided into three stages: the adiabatic inspiral, the transition, and the plunge. To date, constructions of inspiral-transition-plunge waveforms have largely focused on Schwarzschild or Kerr background spacetimes. In this paper, we extend these efforts to spacetimes beyond Kerr by constructing such waveforms in a Kerr-Newman background. For simplicity, we allow the primary black hole to carry spin and charge while keeping the secondary object neutral and non-spinning. We work in the small charge-to-mass ratio regime and adopt the Dudley-Finley approximation, in which the gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations decouple. In particular, the gravitational sector satisfies a Teukolsky-like equation, enabling only minimal modifications relative to the Kerr case when constructing the waveform. Having the inspiral-transtion-plunge waveforms in hand, we studied observational prospects for constraining the charge of the central black hole. We find that, for intermediate-mass-ratio mergers observed with the Einstein Telescope, explicitly modeling the post-inspiral dynamics significantly tightens charge-to-mass ratio constraints. In particular, the bounds on the charge-to-mass ratio can reach $O(10^{-3})$ in the region of primary masses and spins where the post-inspiral signal dominates, yielding charge bounds that can be orders of magnitude tighter than those obtained from the inspiral alone or from the current bound with GW150914. These results lay the groundwork for inspiral-transition-plunge waveform modeling in beyond-Kerr spacetimes and for probing non-Kerr signatures in future GW observations.

Abstract: These lecture notes develop polariton fluids of light as programmable simulators of quantum fields on tailored curved spacetimes, with emphasis on acoustic horizons and the Hawking effect. After introducing exciton-polariton physics in semiconductor microcavities, we detail the theoretical tools to study the mean field and the quantum hydrodynamics of this driven-dissipative quantum system. We derive the mapping to relativistic field theories and cast horizon physics as a pseudounitary stationary scattering problem. We present the Gaussian optics circuit that describes observables and fixes detection weights for the horizon modes in near- and far-field measurements. We provide a practical experimental toolkit (phase-imprinted flows, coherent pump-probe spectroscopy, balanced and homodyne detection) and a step-by-step workflow to extract amplification, quadrature squeezing, and entanglement among correlations. Finally, we discuss the potential of this platform to investigate open questions in quantum field theory in curved spacetime, such as near horizon effects and quasinormal modes, as well as other phenomena universal to rotating geometries, from rotational superradiance to dynamical instabilities. We further outline the interplay between rotational superradiance and the Hawking effect, proposing to spatially resolve measurements as a roadmap for `dumb hole spectroscopy' and the study of entanglement dynamics in curved spacetimes.

Abstract: Analogue gravity explores how collective excitations in condensed matter systems can reproduce the behavior of fields in curved spacetimes. An important example is the acoustic black holes that can occur for sound in a moving fluid. In these lecture notes, we focus on atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), quantum fluids that provide an interesting platform for analogue gravity studies thanks to their accurate theoretical description, remarkable experimental control, and ultralow temperatures that allow the quantum nature of sound to emerge. We give a pedagogical introduction to analogue black holes and the theoretical description of BECs and their elementary excitations, which behave as quantum fields in curved spacetimes. We then apply these tools to survey the current understanding of black-hole superradiance and analogue Hawking radiation, including explicit examples and numerical methods.

Abstract: A recent study [Annals Phys. 455 (2023) 169394, e-Print: 2204.01901 [gr-qc]] examined the thermodynamic behavior of an axially symmetric black hole within a non-commutative framework that mimics the effect of an angular momentum. However, the analysis presents notable computational inconsistencies. In that analysis, the event horizon was miscalculated, and this error propagated through and compromised all subsequent results. In addition, an incorrect definition of surface gravity was used -- the spherically symmetric case was invoked for an axially symmetric spacetime -- rendering the thermodynamic results invalid. In other words, all the results presented in the paper require a thorough reexamination.

Abstract: A discrete class of privileged reference frames in a closed universe with identical equations of motion for physical degrees of freedom was found. A representation of the quantum state of the universe in a privileged reference frame was obtained as a Euclidean functional integral with no-boundary conditions. The boundary condition at the Pole, in addition to the smoothness conditions, is the infinite asymptotic behavior of the Hubble parameter. This makes it possible to regularize the functional integral by changing the sign of the expansion energy of the universe. The proposed construction also allows for the addition of a non-zero proper mass of the universe.

Abstract: Black hole (BH) solutions endowed with nontrivial scalar or matter fields - commonly known as hairy black holes - have attracted significant interest in recent years. They admit extra parameters beyond mass, charge, and angular momentum, leading to a richer phenomenology. Characterizing their allowed parameter space is therefore crucial, especially in light of the available data from electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations. The rotating hairy black hole solutions studied here are inspired by the gravitational decoupling method and satisfy the Einstein field equations with a conserved energy-momentum tensor that respects the strong energy conditions (SECs). We explore in detail the horizon structure of such black holes and report for the first time certain unique features, not observed in Kerr BHs. We investigate the sensitivity of the hairy parameters on the fundamental frequencies associated with the motion of matter in the hairy Kerr spacetime, and compare them with the Kerr scenario. The theoretical models aimed to explain the observed high-frequency observations (HFQPOs) in BHs are associated with the fundamental frequencies. Hence, such a study enables us to constrain the parameter space of the hairy Kerr spacetime by comparing the model-dependent HFQPO frequencies with the available observations. By comparing the kinematic models of HFQPOs with the observations of six BH sources, we report the most favored parameter space for each of these BHs. Our analysis also provides a framework to discern the most suitable model for each of these sources. Interestingly, even with the present precision of the data, the Relativistic Precession Model seems to be less suitable compared to the Tidal Disruption Model for the sources GRO J1655-40 and XTE J1859+226. The implications are discussed.

Abstract: This review examines the role of differential forms, Pfaffian systems, and hypersurfaces in general relativity. These mathematical constructions provide the essential tools for general relativity, in which the curvature of spacetime;described by the Einstein field equations;is most elegantly formulated using the Cartan calculus of differential forms. Another important subject in this discussion is the notion of conformal geometry, where the relevant invariants of a metric are characterized by Elie Cartan's normal conformal connection. The previous analysis is then used to develop the null surface formulation (NSF) of general relativity, a radical framework that postulates the structure of light cones rather than the metric itself as the fundamental gravitational variable. Defined by a central Pfaffian system, this formulation allows the entire spacetime geometry to be reconstructed from a single scalar function, $Z$, whose level surfaces are null.

Abstract: We characterize spin initial data sets that saturate the BPS bound in the asymptotically AdS setting. This includes both gravitational waves and rotating black holes in higher dimensions, and we establish a sharp dimension threshold in each case. A key ingredient in our argument is a theorem providing a general criterion for when an imaginary Killing spinor of mixed causal type can be replaced by one that is strictly timelike or null. Moreover, in analogy with the minimal surface method, we demonstrate that spinors can be used to construct a codimension-$2$ slicing.

Abstract: A set of 3+1 equations for stochastic inflation incorporating all metric and scalar matter degrees of freedom, first presented in previous work, are re-derived in a gauge invariant manner. We then present numerical implementations of these stochastic equations, cast in the BSSN formulation of Numerical Relativity, demonstrating their efficacy in both a slow-roll and an ultra slow-roll scenario. We find the evolution is correctly reproduced for all the dynamical variables, and the energy and momentum constraints are well-satisfied. This demonstrates that the stochastic equations are theoretically and numerically robust and ready to be applied to a wider inflationary landscape. Our simulations result in real space realizations of the fully non-linear stochastic dynamics with gradient information retained. As a generalisation of standard stochastic inflation, inflationary numerical relativity and lattice cosmology, this work opens up the possibility for reliable predictions of non-perturbative phenomena and provides precise initial conditions for subsequent cosmological eras.

Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear tidal response of relativistic neutron stars by computing the fully relativistic, static, quadratic Love numbers. Using both the worldline effective field theory for extended gravitating bodies and second-order perturbations of relativistic stellar models, we derive the nonlinear tidal deformation induced by an external gravito-electric tidal field to quadratic order. Through a suitable matching procedure, we provide for the first time the leading nonlinear tidal corrections to the conservative dynamics and gravitational-wave signal of binary systems. Quadratic Love numbers are enhanced more than the linear ones in the small-compactness limit. Because of this, despite entering the gravitational-wave phase at 8th post-Newtonian (PN) order, the leading quadratic Love number can be as important as the next-to-next-to-leading order linear tidal correction, which enters at 7th PN order, and is larger than the subleading point-particle contribution entering at 4th PN order. In particular, quadratic Love numbers can be as large as ~10% of the linear Love numbers in the late inspiral phase. Our approach provides a framework to also compute the (subleading) nonlinear effects induced by magnetic tidal fields and higher multipole moments, and sets the foundations for incorporating nonlinear tidal effects in high-precision gravitational-wave modeling.

Abstract: We propose a new approach to the quasitopological theory of gravity based on a modified classical double--copy construction. Focusing on static, spherically symmetric configurations, we show that all vacuum solutions of $D$--dimensional quasitopological gravity can be obtained from an auxiliary non--linear electrodynamics defined in a flat $(D+1)$--dimensional spacetime. The gravitational field equations reduce to an algebraic relation between a primary curvature invariant and the electric field strength, while the remaining dynamics is governed by a Gauss--law constraint for a point--like charge in the auxiliary space. This correspondence provides a transparent interpretation of higher--curvature gravitational interactions in terms of non--linear gauge dynamics and explains the absence of higher--derivative terms in the reduced equations. As illustrative examples, we apply the formalism to Born--Infeld and Hayward--type models, obtaining higher--dimensional regular black--hole solutions with a de~Sitter--like core. Our results extend the scope of the double--copy paradigm beyond Einstein gravity and suggest a unifying framework for a broad class of higher--curvature theories.

Abstract: The growing number of gravitational wave (GW) detections and the increasing sensitivity of GW detectors have enabled precision tests of General Relativity (GR) in the strong-field regime. The recent observation of multiple quasinormal modes (QNMs) in GW250114 marks a major advance for observational black hole spectroscopy. This clear signal, together with the growing number of GW detections, highlights the need for accurate predictions of QNM spectra in beyond-GR theories in order to carry out precision searches for new physics. In this work, we continue to lay the foundation for such predictions using a modified Teukolsky formalism in conjunction with the eigenvalue perturbation method. We compute the spectral shifts of slowly rotating Johannsen-Psaltis black holes for $2 \leq \ell \leq 10$, all $m$, and overtones $n = 0, 1, 2$, and confirm the large-$\ell$ behavior of the modes by comparing with the WKB approximation. We find that these black holes admit definite-parity modes but break the isospectrality between even- and odd-parity QNMs at all spins, and that the shifts depend linearly on $m$ for slow spins. We further derive a general parity condition that any beyond-GR modification to the metric must satisfy to support definite-parity modes, providing new insights into isospectrality breaking and parity structure in gravitational perturbations.

Abstract: We develop a differential formulation of the Loeb Scale that extends the original static framework into a radially evolving, real time classification scheme for interstellar objects. By promoting each anomaly metric to a function of heliocentric distance and introducing a relaxation equation for the effective score, our method incorporates memory, hysteresis and predictive capability. This allows us to have early, stable forecasts of an object's eventual Loeb level based on sparse data obtained at large distances, which is more helpful to quantify its true nature when near Earth.

Abstract: Transmission and eclipse spectroscopy have been invaluable tools for the characterisation of extrasolar planet atmospheres. While they will continue to provide many new insights and discoveries in the decade(s) to come, these methods are running up against sources of stellar noise from stellar surface inhomogeneities and variability. In this white paper we discuss how the next steps in the characterisation of small, temperate rocky planets requires high-contrast imaging, making the planetary systems around our closest neighbouring stars the new frontier in exoplanet science. The Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) will be at the forefront of this quest. The Planetary Camera and Spectrograph (PCS) on ESO's ELT and GmagAO-X on the GMT are planned to become operational in the 2035-2040 time-frame, allowing the characterisation of up to dozen(s) of rocky planets around nearby red dwarf stars. We discuss what role there will be still to play for ground-based exoplanet characterisation in the era of the space-borne Habitable Worlds Observatory and LIFE missions.

Abstract: Cool gas giant exoplanets, particularly those with properties similar to those of Jupiter and Saturn, remain poorly characterized due to current observational limitations. This white paper outlines the transformative science case for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) to directly image and spectroscopically characterize a broad range of gaseous exoplanets with effective temperatures below 400 K. The study focuses on determining key atmospheric properties, including molecular composition, cloud and haze characteristics, and temperature structure, across planets of varying sizes and orbital separations. Leveraging reflected light spectroscopy and polarimetry, HWO will enable comparative planetology of cool gas giants orbiting both solar-type and M-dwarf stars, bridging the observational gap between hot exoplanets and Solar System giants. We present observational requirements and survey strategies necessary to uncover correlations between atmospheric properties and planetary or stellar parameters. This effort will establish critical constraints on planetary formation, cloud microphysics, and the role of photochemistry under diverse irradiation conditions. The unique capabilities of HWO will make it the first facility capable of characterizing true exo-Jupiters in reflected light, thus offering an unprecedented opportunity to place the Solar System in a broader galactic context.

Abstract: Understanding how mass and angular momentum flow through accretion discs remains a fundamental unsolved problem in astrophysics. Accreting white dwarfs offer an ideal laboratory for addressing this question: their variability occurs on accessible timescales of seconds to minutes, and their optical spectra contain continuum and emission-line components that trace distinct disc regions. Broad-band timing studies have revealed time-lags similar to those observed in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei, suggesting propagating fluctuations and possible coupling to an inner hot flow. However, the blending of line and continuum light in broad filters prevents a physical interpretation of these signals. The 2040s will bring an unprecedented number of disc-accreting systems discovered by Rubin-LSST, space-based gravitational-wave observatories, and third-generation ground and space-based detectors. To extract disc physics from these sources, high-cadence optical spectral-timing, simultaneously resolving continuum and individual lines, is essential. Such measurements would directly map how variability propagates through discs, determine how the outer disc responds to changes in the inner flow, and test whether accretion physics is scale-invariant from white dwarfs to supermassive black holes. This white paper outlines the scientific motivation and observational capabilities required to realise this vision. It highlights the opportunity for ESO to enable a transformative new window on accretion physics in the coming decade.

Abstract: The magnetospheres of neutron stars in the Galactic Center provide an exceptional environment to search for dark matter axions through their resonant conversion into photons. The combination of extreme magnetic fields and high dark matter density in this region creates ideal conditions for axion-photon conversion across the centimetre-to-submillimetre wavelength range. Detecting the cumulative emission from these neutron star populations demands a facility with unprecedented sensitivity, spatial resolution, and broad frequency coverage in the submillimetre domain, capabilities essential to explore a previously inaccessible region of axion parameter space.

Abstract: Millisecond pulsar (MSP) binaries are unique laboratories for studying matter and radiation under extreme conditions that are unattainable on Earth. Recent detections of optical millisecond pulsations from three systems in distinct evolutionary stages have opened an entirely new observational window to investigate particle acceleration, pulsar-disk interplay, and intrabinary wind interactions. These discoveries reveal unexpectedly diverse emission mechanisms across accretion regimes, with optical efficiencies in some systems far exceeding those predicted by rotation-powered models. Despite decades of research, key questions remain unresolved: are optical pulsations a universal property of MSPs? How does the presence of an accretion disk boost the conversion of spin-down power into coherent optical emission? What physical processes drive the observed fast variability, and how do pulsar and companion winds regulate mass transfer and binary evolution? Addressing these fundamental problems requires high-time-resolution optical observations, rapid-response observing capabilities, and time-resolved spectroscopy at moderate spectral resolution to map disk and intrabinary-shock variability. Future facilities dedicated to time domain astronomy present a unique opportunity to perform a systematic exploration of optical pulsars across all MSP evolutionary stages for the first time and answer the above-mentioned fundamental questions.

Abstract: Astronomical light curves are noisy and irregular, so compression must reduce size without erasing weak transients. We propose a fractional wavelet compression method where wavelet coefficients are regularized via an Atangana Baleanu Caputo derivative with a nonsingular Mittag Leffler kernel. The induced long memory smoothing suppresses noise while preserving coherent transits, flares and oscillations. We give the coefficient level formulation, an efficient implementation, and comparisons with classical discrete wavelet thresholding, showing competitive compression with improved retention of low-amplitude events.

Upcoming multi-wavelength and multi-messenger facilities will reveal fast, faint, rapidly evolving Northern transients whose earliest phases carry decisive diagnostics. A Northern ELT with rapid response, broad wavelength coverage, high time resolution, polarimetric capabilities, and diffraction-limited imaging is essential to capture these phases and secure deep spectroscopy and photometry as transients fade. These capabilities will enable recovery of key physical information and detailed characterisation of transient environments, while also enabling unprecedented studies of accretion phenomena at all scales. Among potential sites, La Palma uniquely combines atmospheric stability, complementary longitude to ESO's ELT, protected dark skies, and robust infrastructure to host this facility.

Abstract: Multi-messenger astronomy will be transformed in the 2040s by an unprecedented volume of detections from next-generation gravitational wave, high-energy, and ultra-high energy neutrino, cosmic ray, and time domain observatories. This white paper, prepared for the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Expanding Horizons call, outlines the key science questions enabled by this emerging multi-messenger ecosystem, ranging from nucleosynthesis and dense matter physics to cosmology, fundamental physics, and the growth of black holes across cosmic time. We demonstrate that fully exploiting these discoveries requires a step change in optical to near infrared spectroscopic capability, including low latency response, high throughput, and flexible time domain operations across both hemispheres. We argue that without a dedicated large-aperture time domain facility, the scientific return of multi-messenger astronomy in the 2040s will be considerably limited.

Abstract: With large numbers of transients discovered by current and future imaging surveys, machine learning is increasingly applied to light curve and host galaxy properties to select events for follow-up. However, finding rare types of transients remains difficult due to extreme class imbalances in training sets, and extracting features from host images is complicated by the presence of bright foreground sources, particularly if the true host is faint or distant. Here we present a data augmentation pipeline for images and light curves that mitigates these issues, and apply this to improve classification of Superluminous Supernovae Type I (SLSNe-I) and Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) with our existing NEEDLE code. The method uses a Similarity Index to remove image artefacts, and a masking procedure that removes unrelated sources while preserving the transient and its host. This focuses classifier attention on the relevant pixels, and enables arbitrary rotations for class upsampling. We also fit observed multi-band light curves with a two-dimensional Gaussian Process and generate data-driven synthetic samples by resampling and redshifting these models, cross-matching with galaxy images in the same class to produce unique but realistic new examples for training. Models trained with the augmented dataset achieve substantially higher purity: for classifications with a confidence of 0.8 or higher, we achieve 75% (43%) purity and 75% (66%) completeness for SLSNe-I (TDEs).

Abstract: Our objective is to characterize the QUIJOTE Thirty and Forty GHz instrument (TFGI), calibrate it with a reference calibration signal on the ground, compare our results with on-sky calibration based on bright sources, and study the stability of the calibration parameters over time. First, from the ground, we fit the data using a reference calibration signal (a diode) introduced to resolve degeneracies among the various instrument angles. Finally, we utilize on-sky observations of Tau A and the Moon to validate the results. By creating calibration datasets obtained with the reference diode, we evaluate the data quality and quantify phase switch errors to account for the fine polarization response. We also utilize Tau A and Moon observations to calibrate the system's response and stability over time. In addition, we calculate the refraction index of the Moon to be $n_{Moon}$ = 1.209 $\pm$ 0.007 (stat) $\pm$ 0.005 (sys) at 31 GHz under smooth-surface assumption. The results from fitting the instrument phase-switch error angle align with 0 deg at 2$σ$ precision, indicating that no further correction is required within a few percent precision. The calibrations with astrophysical sources (Tau A and the Moon) yield consistent results that constrain the polarization angle and responsivity. The polarization efficiency aligns well with ground measurements and the Tau A characterization, whereas the Moon-based calibration is more affected by systematics. We find hints of responsivity variations over time, although the relative responsivity between channels is found to remain stable. In the future, we conclude that installing a live calibrator will enhance performance by continuously monitoring responsivity and, in turn, improving the mitigation of systematic effects.

Abstract: The Milky Way (MW) is our unique laboratory to test star formation theories at the level of individual stars, serving as the Rosetta Stone to interpret extragalactic observations. The proposed White Paper focuses on the following key questions regarding the structure and evolution of the MW traced by young stellar populations: Q1. How do large-scale dynamical instabilities, like warps and vertical waves, drive the star formation of the Galactic thin disk? Q2. Do star-forming regions form stochastically, driven by local self-propagating feedback, or are they triggered by a common dynamical process acting on Galactic scales? Do internal feedback loops and external interactions tend to sustain or quench star formation in the MW? Q3. Are the clustered star-forming regions the only environments where stars form, or can stars also form in more diffuse structures such as the stellar strings?
