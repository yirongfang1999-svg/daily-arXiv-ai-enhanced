In the absence of radiative cooling, recent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations have shown that high-energy particles gain most of their energy in the upstream region, during a short-lived \"free phase\" where they meander between the two sides of the layer; when they get captured/trapped by the downstream flux ropes, they undergo a \"trapped phase\", where no significant energization occurs. Here, we perform a suite of 3D PIC simulations of relativistic reconnection including inverse Compton (IC) losses in the weakly cooled regime in which the radiation-reaction-limited Lorentz factor $\u03b3_{\\rm rad}$ exceeds the magnetization $\u03c3$. We show that electron cooling losses do not appreciably alter the reconnection rate, the structure of the layer, and the physics of particle acceleration in the free phase, so the spectrum of free electrons is $dN_{\\rm free}/d\u03b3\\propto \u03b3^{-1}$, as in the uncooled case. The spectrum of trapped electrons above the cooling break $\u03b3_{\\rm cool}$ (in the range $\u03b3_{\\rm cool}<\u03b3<\u03b3_{\\rm rad}$) is $dN/d\u03b3\\propto \u03b3^{-3}$, steeper than the scaling $dN/d\u03b3\\propto \u03b3^{-2}$ of uncooled simulations. This confirms that no significant particle energization occurs during the trapped phase. Our results validate the model by arXiv:2302.12269 for particle acceleration in 3D relativistic reconnection, and imply that radiative emission models of reconnection-powered astrophysical sources should employ a two-zone structure, that differentiates between free, rapidly accelerating particles and trapped, passively cooling particles.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The Surface Biosignatures Task assessed the measurement requirements and instrument needs to detect these biosignatures under an 'Earth through time' scenario. Surface biosignatures are planetary-scale spectral features resulting from absorption and/or scattering of radiation by organisms containing photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic pigments. This secondary class of biosignature can be used to corroborate atmospheric biosignatures by providing multiple lines of evidence to aid in assessing their biogenicity. Furthermore, surface biopigments are the only way to detect more primitive forms of anoxygenic photosynthesis if oxygenic photosynthesis never evolved. Key Findings: To detect biopigments on the surface of planets under Archean, Proterozoic, and Modern atmospheric compositions (15 percent coverage, 50 percent cloud cover), an SNR of 20-40 would be needed over 500-1100 nm. However, there may be some cases in which lower SNR is required; studies are ongoing. Coronagraph requirements: (1) The detection of surface biosignatures would be greatly enhanced by having as many parallel coronagraph channels as possible across the entire wavelength range with no or minimal gaps between channels. (2) Retrieval studies revealed that restricted wavelength ranges (e.g., 0.4 - 0.7 microns), such as may be used during initial survey strategies, are not sufficient to deconvolve the biopigment features from the abiotic background.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We inject a jet beam carrying an initially toroidal magnetic field into a denser, unmagnetized, and stratified ambient medium through a cylindrical nozzle. Our simulations explore jets with varying injection parameters to investigate their impact on morphology and emission properties. Furthermore, we examine jets with significantly different plasma compositions, such as hadronic and mixed electron-positron-proton configurations, to study the conditions that may drive transitions between FR I and FR II morphologies. We find that, under the same injection parameters, mixed plasma composition jets tend to evolve into FR I structures.

Using binary population synthesis, we construct synthetic X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) for both classical and log-modified beaming models at solar and sub-solar metallicities. The classical model predicts a larger intrinsic number of bright ULXs, but strong beaming reduces their observable fraction, resulting in fewer visible ULXs compared to the log-modified model. The log-modified prescription yields a shallower slope at high-luminosity, aligning better with observed XLFs, and increases the fraction of observable neutron star ULXs above 10^39 erg/s.

A firm identification of the source of the NG15 signal requires an accurate reconstruction of its frequency spectrum. In this paper, we provide such a spectral characterization of the NG15 signal based on a piecewise power-law (PPL) ansatz that strikes a balance between existing alternatives in the literature. Our PPL reconstruction is more flexible than the standard constant-power-law model, which describes the GWB spectrum in terms of only two parameters: an amplitude A and a spectral index gamma. Concurrently, it better approximates physically realistic GWB spectra -- especially those of cosmological origin -- than the free spectral model, since the latter allows for arbitrary variations in the GWB amplitude from one frequency bin to the next. Our PPL reconstruction of the NG15 signal relies on individual PPL models with a fixed number of internal nodes (i.e., constant power law, broken power law, doubly broken power law, etc.) that are ultimately combined in a Bayesian model average. The data products resulting from our analysis provide the basis for fast refits of spectral GWB models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The angular tidal force is predominantly compressive, $l$ shaping the effective geometry, and $\u03b3$ acting as a damping factor. In the phantom sector ($\u03b1=-1$), tidal forces and geodesic deviation diverge, indicating a tidal instability, with $l$ and $\u03b3$ affecting only the magnitude of the response.
