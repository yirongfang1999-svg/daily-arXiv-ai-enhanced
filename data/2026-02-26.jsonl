They occur in magnetically dominated plasma and are described by relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We present global relativistic MHD simulations of monster shocks in unperturbed and perturbed (``wrinkled'') backgrounds with a global dipolar geometry. Our simulations confirm analytical predictions for equatorial shocks and provide new insight into the behavior of oblique shocks off the equator. Simulations where the shock is formed through Alfvén mode to fast mode conversion are also presented, demonstrating the generic nature of the monster shock mechanism. We explore how the presence of additional modes in the magnetosphere modifies the shock behavior. Modes of comparable amplitude can fragment the shock front, substantially reduce the magnetization, produce localized enhancements in the Lorentz factor relative to an unperturbed dipole background, and intermittently generate additional shocks along a line of sight."}

Unlike all previous unmagnetized AIC models - which predicted proton-rich, $^{56}$Ni-dominated ejecta - strong magnetic fields eject ${\\sim 0.2 M_\\odot}$ of neutron-rich material $(\\langle Y_e \\rangle \\sim 0.24)$ on dynamical timescales, before neutrino irradiation can raise the electron fraction, enabling strong $r$-process nucleosynthesis up to and beyond the third peak. The resulting kilonova is lanthanide-rich $(X_{\\rm lan} \\approx 6\\%)$ and dominated by near-infrared emission. We compute synthetic light curves in the LSST and JWST bands and find striking agreement, without parameter tuning, between the observations of AT 2023vfi/GRB 230307A and our broadband light curves for polar viewing angles.

Harris", "Srimoyee Sen"], "title": "Shock-induced chiral magnetic effect", "comment": "22 pages, 8 figures", "summary": "Weak-interaction-mediated chiral imbalance generation in idealized massless electrons during core-collapse supernovae was once proposed to be the source of strong magnetic fields found in neutron stars. The effect goes by the name of chiral plasma instability (CPI). However, it was found that a finite electron mass damps out this process, inactivating the instability and preventing magnetic field growth. In this work we show that the instability can survive in the presence of abrupt density and temperature perturbation that drives the system sufficiently far out of weak equilibrium. As an example, we work with such perturbations generated by shockwaves which are common during both core collapse as well as neutron star mergers. We find that the chiral imbalance resulting from shock waves, under the right conditions of density and temperature, can sustain the chiral plasma instability despite the damping from the electron mass. Additionally, in an already magnetized medium, the chiral magnetic effect resulting from shock wave density and temperature perturbation can generate substantial ohmic heating. Our results imply that shockwaves during core-collapse supernovae and merging neutron stars can act as a source of strong heating in a magnetized medium as well as CPI."}

Autonomous, radio-frequency (RF) UHE-$ν$ detetectors have been deployed in polar regions that rely on the Askaryan effect in ice for the neutrino signal. The Askaryan effect occurs when the excess negative charge within a UHE-$ν$ cascade radiates in a dense medium. UHE-$ν$ can induce cascades that radiate in the RF bandwidth above thermal backgrounds. To identify UHE-$ν$ signals in data from Askaryan-class detectors, analytic models of the Askaryan electromagnetic field have been created and matched to simulations and laboratory measurements. These models describe the Askaryan electromagnetic field, but leave the effects of signal propagation through polar ice and RF channel response to simulations. In this work, a fully analytic Askaryan model that accounts for these effects is presented. First, formulas for the observed voltage trace and its Hilbert envelope are calculated. Second, the analytic model is compared to UHE-$ν$ signals at 100 PeV from NuRadioMC, a key Monte Carlo toolset in the field. Correlation coefficients between the analytic signal envelope and MC data in excess of $0.94$ are found, and 99.99% of UHE-$ν$ signals pass a correlation threshold of $ρ\\geq 0.4$. Analysis of RF thermal noise reveals that just 0.2 background events have $ρ\\geq 0.4$ in 5 years at a 1 Hz thermal trigger rate. Finally, we describe future work related to the measurement of the logarithm of the UHE-$ν$ cascade energy."}

To appear in European Journal of Physics", "summary": "Black holes are some of the most interesting objects in the universe. While they first arise in the complicated behavior of general relativity, the physical laws ruling their behavior are surprisingly simple. For example, one of the core facts about black holes is that their area never decreases, much alike the entropy in thermodynamics. In this note directed at introductory physics students and their instructors, we use this similarity to understand properties of black hole physics using standard techniques from an undergraduate course in thermal physics. We explore the never-decreasing nature of black hole area to obtain bounds on the energy emitted in a black hole merger (a calculation originally done by Hawking). We show how this allows us to think of black holes in manners very similar to heat engines, and how these ideas have been used in modern gravitational wave observatories to test general relativity. This allows a research-level topic to be discussed in introductory physics lectures."}

Accepted for publication in ApJ", "summary": "GRB 250221A is a short gamma-ray burst (GRB) at redshift $z=0.768$, with a duration of 1.8 s and no extended emission in either Swift/BAT or Konus-Wind bands. A remarkable re-brightening feature in both optical and X-ray bands was observed at $\\sim 0.6$ days after the burst trigger, but no supernova or kilonova signature was detected. The burst properties and empirical correlations or distributions (e.g., duration, spectral hardness, location in the Amati correlation, $\\varepsilon-$value, $f_{\\rm eff}$ parameter, and physical offset) favor a compact binary merger origin. However, a dense circumburst medium with $n\\sim 80\\rm~cm^{-3}$, obtained by adopting the energy injection into a jet to interpret the late-time re-brightening is inconsistent with the compact binary merger origin. In this paper, we propose a two-component jet model to explain the multiwavelength afterglow observations of GRB 250221A, in which the relativistic narrow jet ($\\rm θ_{c} \\sim 3.8^\\circ$) produces the prompt and the early decay afterglow emission, while the mildly relativistic wide jet ($\\rm θ_{w} \\sim 4.4^\\circ$) dominates at later times, resulting in the observed re-brightening feature. If this is the case, one can obtain a lower medium density with $n\\sim 0.72\\rm~cm^{-3}$ which is a little bit higher than that of short GRBs in merger environments, but falls into the reasonable and acceptable range. Finally, a possible kilonova emission is also discussed within the scenario of compact star merger origin of GRB 250221A."}

For Centaurus~A, our reconstruction reveals two prominent emission ridges ($\\simeq 80\\,μ$as each) along the jet sheath with a brightness ratio of $1.4\\pm 0.1$ and an opening angle of $12.3\\pm 0.3$~deg. For 3C~279, we identify three distinct components in the image, with the southern jet ejecta on sub-parsec scale exhibiting a proper motion of $4.6\\pm 1.0\\,μ$as over $\\approx 5.39$ days away from the northern components, corresponding to an apparent superluminal velocity of $\\simeq 10\\pm 2$ times light speed. These measurements are consistent with those reported by the EHT Collaboration. The results are significant because we demonstrate that: (1) imaging from interferometric aperture synthesis data, especially in VLBI and most acutely in extremely sparse arrays like the EHT, remains a severely ill-posed and challenging inverse problem, yet closure invariants preserve robust morphological information that can strongly constrain structural features, and (2) more importantly, closure-invariant imaging largely avoids calibration systematics, thus providing a fundamentally independent view of spatial structure with very high angular resolution. The generative nature of GenDIReCT further allows us to sample and characterise clusters of plausible image solutions for each dataset. As a calibration-independent, generative imaging approach, GenDIReCT offers a robust and truly independent blind-imaging tool for current and future VLBI experiments."}

Starting from standard Hartle--Hawking and tunneling boundary conditions, we emphasize that semiclassical WKB structure and inflationary squeezing do not by themselves yield classicality. Tracing over unobserved degrees of freedom and using the influence functional formalism, we derive the decoherence functional for superhorizon curvature modes during inflation. For a light massive environmental scalar field in the Bunch--Davies vacuum, we obtain an explicit noise kernel and show how a nonzero mass regulates the infrared behavior. We then evaluate decoherence under horizon-based and EFT-motivated coarse grainings, finding efficient suppression of interference between macroscopically distinct perturbation histories in both cases. The analysis clarifies the distinct roles of boundary conditions (branch amplitudes) and decoherence (classical branch selection) and yields an emergent cosmological arrow of time through environment-induced entanglement."}

Utilizing ten years of IceCube muon-track data, we investigate potential correlations between the GP neutrinos and $γ$-ray sources in the first LHAASO catalog (1LHAASO). To avoid issues caused by spectral extrapolation, this analysis focuses on sources detected by the Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA). We employ an unbinned likelihood analysis to search for neutrino emission and constrain the hadronic $γ$-ray component of these sources. Neither single-source searches nor stacking analyses reveal significant neutrino signals. The stacking analysis indicates that the 1LHAASO WCDA population contributes at most $\\sim$20\\% to the diffuse GP neutrino flux measured by IceCube. The total hadronic contribution to the cumulative $γ$-ray emission from all WCDA sources is constrained to be at most $\\sim$$60\\%$, suggesting a predominantly leptonic origin for the $γ$-ray emission from the LHAASO source population. Even accounting for unresolved sources below the detection threshold, we estimate the total neutrino flux from all discrete sources (resolved plus unresolved) reaches at most about 40\\% of the observed GP neutrino flux. These results support that the bulk of the GP neutrino emission is mainly from truly diffuse processes, i.e., cosmic-ray interactions with the interstellar medium, rather than from unresolved point sources."}

Using the fully covariant vector boson formalism and covariant Maxwell theory, we derive an exact Schrödinger-type radial equation with a curvature-induced effective potential. Recasting the dynamics in Helmholtz form yields an effective refractive-index profile, showing that the wormhole acts as an inhomogeneous optical medium with position-dependent refractive index and frequency-dependent confinement, where low-frequency modes are strongly trapped while high-frequency modes propagate almost freely. A differential-geometric correspondence with helicoidal surfaces is established via $1/[a^2(1-η)] \\leftrightarrow w^2$, demonstrating that Lorentz-violation-induced curvature is mathematically equivalent to curvature generated by geometric twist and linking the model to twisted graphene nanoribbons as analog-gravity platforms.

Examining its behavior in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime reveals a mechanism in which the symmetry between energy and momentum is dynamically broken. Applying this concept naturally leads to the derivation of the familiar LCDM model, while simultaneously alleviating both the fine-tuning and coincidence problems. Comparison of the ground-state energy behavior in the Friedmann equations with a dust matter field further indicates that large-scale matter exhibits the same symmetry-breaking behavior. Remarkably, due to this broken symmetry, the interactions between local regions of matter in the large-scale structure generate effective pressure, driving late-time acceleration and reproducing the LCDM expansion history without invoking exotic fields or negative-pressure components. This framework provides a self-consistent realization of LCDM within General Relativity, emerging entirely from the intrinsic dynamics of standard matter without fine-tuning and coincidence problems."}

By perturbing the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for photon null geodesics, we demonstrate that the unique field content of MOG breaks the observational degeneracy with standard General Relativity. We mathematically prove two distinct, time-dependent signatures. First, the massless MOG scalar field induces a volumetric ``breathing mode'' polarization, causing the total apparent area of the shadow to rhythmically expand and contract. Second, the massive MOG vector field undergoes quantum vacuum dispersion, arriving at the observer with a predictable time delay. This delayed massive wave sources secondary longitudinal metric perturbations that manifest as a sudden, asymmetric translational wobble of the shadow on the celestial screen. These dynamic geometric shifts offer a robust observational template for next-generation interferometry to strictly test the existence of massive force carriers and scalar fields in gravity."}

The present paper addresses the inverse problem, for which we consider quadrupole moments of pulsar timings due to GWs from a dominant isolated source such as a binary of supermassive black holes over an isotropic stochastic background. Correlations between the quadrupole moments are discussed, where the correlations between pulsar pairs over the full sky are taken into account. The correlations turn out to be in the form of a three-dimensional traceless matrix with rank 2 that can be closely related with a projection tensor for the GW. Thereby, we demonstrate that the rank-2 matrix allows to estimate the DOA of the GW. In expectation of the forthcoming Square Kilometer Array, angular resolutions as well as DOA estimation errors are also examined."}

To our surprise, this effort led to the discovery of GW070605, what at first appeared to be a previously unreported high significance binary neutron star merger at a time when only the Livingston detector (L1) was operating -- data that could not have been analyzed and a signal that could not have been discovered previously because the algorithms of the day required coincidence between two or more detectors. GW070605's end time occurs in LIGO's L1 detector at 2007-06-05 18:37:02 UTC, and is estimated to be a merger with component masses of 1.82$M_\\odot$ and 1.24$M_\\odot$. The GstLAL detection algorithm estimates that noise processes produce false positives at least as significant as GW070605 at a rate of $8.6\\times10^{-10}$ per year. Disappointingly, subsequent investigations revealed the presence of a previously undocumented hardware injection in the L1 detector's Y arm end test mass' excitation channel, whose time and properties match that of GW070605. The injection does not appear in the Gravitational Wave Open Science Center list of hardware injections. We determined that while there is no sensitivity improvement between GstLAL and previous algorithms at the null-result threshold, there is marked improvement at above null-result thresholds; specifically, an approximately 55-times detection rate increase from initial-era algorithms at a FAR threshold of 1 per 7000 years."}

We introduce a third possibility: Einstein-frame time can dynamically attain a local minimum. This time-reversal is caused by phantom Chaplygin gas, whose acoustic cone defines a `causal-frame' geometry that is geodesically-complete. While gravity experiences time-reversal, the Chaplygin gas always evolves forward in time, realizing a transient mismatch in thermodynamic arrows of time. Time-reversal affects the scale-factor, enforcing a non-singular bounce in causal frame that is robust against any additional matter."}

Following a brief review of the magnetic reconnection process in the plunging region of a Kerr black hole, we introduce the hotspot model and imaging method. Based on numerical simulations, we separately study the hotspot images in the plunging region without magnetic reconnection, with magnetic reconnection, and when the escape condition is not met. We also compare these with hotspot images in the circular orbit region. The results show that for hotspot images without magnetic reconnection, if the plasma follow plunging orbits, the flare intensity gradually decreases, whereas if they follow circular orbits, the flare intensity remains nearly constant. Additionally, we find that in the plunging region, the signal for energy extraction is weaker compared to that in the circular orbit region."}

Within the Teo wormhole ansatz with unit lapse and Morris-Thorne shape function, we solve analytically for the frame-dragging function and obtain a two-parameter family of asymptotically flat solutions labelled by the throat radius $r_0$ and total angular momentum $J$. Curvature scalars and stress-energy components are given in closed form, showing a regular throat, equatorial reflection symmetry, and violations of all standard energy conditions, as required for traversable wormholes. We analyse the causal structure and show that, despite the presence of an ergoregion for sufficiently large $|J|$, the coordinate time defines a global temporal function, so the spacetime is stably causal and free of closed timelike curves. The optical appearance is studied via photon trajectories. The resulting shadows are smaller than Kerr's and depend on the wormhole shape. Finally, we compute the Geroch-Hansen multipole moments and find a massless but spinning configuration with distinctive higher multipoles that encode the throat scale."}

To appear in European Journal of Physics", "summary": "Black holes are some of the most interesting objects in the universe. While they first arise in the complicated behavior of general relativity, the physical laws ruling their behavior are surprisingly simple. For example, one of the core facts about black holes is that their area never decreases, much alike the entropy in thermodynamics. In this note directed at introductory physics students and their instructors, we use this similarity to understand properties of black hole physics using standard techniques from an undergraduate course in thermal physics. We explore the never-decreasing nature of black hole area to obtain bounds on the energy emitted in a black hole merger (a calculation originally done by Hawking). We show how this allows us to think of black holes in manners very similar to heat engines, and how these ideas have been used in modern gravitational wave observatories to test general relativity. This allows a research-level topic to be discussed in introductory physics lectures."}

Recent studies show that some PBHs can survive to the present epoch by gaining angular momentum through Hawking radiating photons and becoming extremal before complete evaporation. While this provides a plausible model in a two-derivative theory of gravity, additional issues arise in EFT-corrected theories of gravity. In such theories, a rapidly spinning black hole can lead to extremely high tidal forces on a near-horizon observer, with possible observational consequences. In this work, by modeling Hawking radiation as a biased random walk within an EFT of gravity, we show that nearly the same fraction of PBHs survives as in GR. We argue that the resultant near horizon tidal effects should be detectable in future gravitational-wave observables."}

This first-epoch survey will reach $\\mathrm{H}\\sim25.5$ AB mag (5$σ$) and maximize synergies with contemporaneous observatories, while preserving substantial time for other ambitious Roman programs. We outline representative scheduling scenarios and an example Cycle 1 program that triples early Roman-LSST overlap and delivers high-value community data products such as LSST forced photometry, joint \\textit{Gaia}-Roman astrometry, and catalogs of Galactic substructure, stong lenses, and other rare systems. The Cycle 1 program will lay the foundation for an eventual all-sky survey, while also delivering high-impact early science.

For Centaurus~A, our reconstruction reveals two prominent emission ridges ($\\simeq 80\\,μ$as each) along the jet sheath with a brightness ratio of $1.4\\pm 0.1$ and an opening angle of $12.3\\pm 0.3$~deg. For 3C~279, we identify three distinct components in the image, with the southern jet ejecta on sub-parsec scale exhibiting a proper motion of $4.6\\pm 1.0\\,μ$as over $\\approx 5.39$ days away from the northern components, corresponding to an apparent superluminal velocity of $\\simeq 10\\pm 2$ times light speed. These measurements are consistent with those reported by the EHT Collaboration. The results are significant because we demonstrate that: (1) imaging from interferometric aperture synthesis data, especially in VLBI and most acutely in extremely sparse arrays like the EHT, remains a severely ill-posed and challenging inverse problem, yet closure invariants preserve robust morphological information that can strongly constrain structural features, and (2) more importantly, closure-invariant imaging largely avoids calibration systematics, thus providing a fundamentally independent view of spatial structure with very high angular resolution. The generative nature of GenDIReCT further allows us to sample and characterise clusters of plausible image solutions for each dataset. As a calibration-independent, generative imaging approach, GenDIReCT offers a robust and truly independent blind-imaging tool for current and future VLBI experiments."}

To meet this need, this study extends a robust statistical framework, advancing previous work on heavy-tailed likelihoods, that adapts the hyperbolic likelihood method for full frequency domain applications. The framework is designed to maintain high performance under ideal conditions while improving robustness against non-Gaussian noise and outliers in real-world data. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach through two key case studies. The first case study analyzes a massive black hole binary merger in simulated Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) data with Gaussian noise, showing that the extended hyperbolic likelihood method performs comparably to the more commonly used Whittle likelihood. The second case study examines a stellar-mass black hole binary merger using real ground-based gravitational-wave data containing non-Gaussian noise or overlapping signals, where our framework exhibits increased robustness and yields more accurate parameter estimations. Our results show that the hyperbolic likelihood better captures the true noise distribution, providing a flexible and physically motivated alternative for GW data analysis across current and future detectors."}
