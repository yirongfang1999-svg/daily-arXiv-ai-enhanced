For this we approximately model the merger site electromagnetic fields as the superposition of two rotating dipolar stellar magnetic fields at the thousand--km scale when both magnetospheres are not largely distorted. We capture the time-sliced near-zone magnetospheric geometry relevant for axion--photon mixing. Plasma effects are incorporated through an effective Goldreich--Julian charge density, used to determine the effective plasma frequency and the location of resonant conversion surfaces. Our results show that axion--photon resonant conversion in binary magnetospheres mostly occurs on extended peanut-shaped surfaces whose global geometry evolves as the binary inspiral evolves. As a consequence, the total electromagnetic power emitted through axion--photon conversion exhibits a characteristic dependence on axion mass and a slow temporal modulation correlated with the gravitational wave frequency emission.

We model the ultraviolet (UV) and optical signatures of such disk instabilities, expected from the accretion power being reprocessed by the optically-thick outflow following super-Eddington accretion. Our model predicts brief UV-bright transients lasting for days, with luminosities of $10^{42}$-$10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in near-UV and $10^{41}$-$10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in optical for a typical TDE by a $10^6~M_\\odot$ black hole.

The orbits of the photon and massive particles are investigated in the background, where there is a negative mass object which realises a kind of effective anti-gravity.

However, due to their weak coupling to external tidal fields, their effect on the gravitational-wave (GW) signal of binary inspirals can be difficult to observe. Here we show that the detectability of these tides can be significantly enhanced by binary NSs with moderate eccentricities. This is primarily due to higher eccentric harmonics in the early phase of the binary evolution experiencing larger phase shifts, which they transport to the sensitive band of GW detectors. In addition, g-mode tides in eccentric binaries undergo several epicyclic resonances, which also amplify the total phase shift. We demonstrate that these effects increase the detectability of g-mode dynamical tides by more than an order of magnitude for eccentricities of $e_\\mathrm{10Hz}\\sim0.2-0.4$, making it possible to put robust constraints on g-mode properties using current GW detectors, while all relevant models could potentially be constrained with eccentric binary NSs with Einstein Telescope.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Such triggers are essential for coordinating rapid electromagnetic follow-up. In this work, we introduce GW-FALCON, a novel feature-driven DL framework for early-time detection between GW signal+noise and noise-only data in next-generation detectors. Instead of feeding raw time series to CNN or more complex neural network architectures, we first extract a large set of statistical, temporal, and spectral quantities from short observational time windows using the TSFEL library. The resulting fixed-length feature vectors are then used as input to feed-forward ANNs suitable for low-latency operation. We demonstrate the method using simulated BNS and NSBH inspiral waveforms injected into colored Gaussian noise generated from the ET and CE design PSDs. We train separate ANNs on feature sets extracted from partial-inspiral windows characterized by different maximum instantaneous frequencies, enabling early-warning triggers from tens to hundreds of seconds before merger. Across all detector configurations and datasets, the resulting classifiers achieve high accuracy and detection efficiency, with ET-like networks typically reaching test accuracies of order 90% and CE-like ones exceeding 97% at low false-alarm probability. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first comprehensive feature-based DL detection framework for Next-generation GW observatories, connecting feature extraction from strain time series data to robust signal-noise classification within a setup that can be extended to real data and to more advanced neural network architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The supernova remnant (SNR) G292.0+1.8 is one of only three known oxygen-rich SNRs in the galaxy-remnants of core-collapse for which relatively pure fragments of ejecta can be seen. Several dozen ejecta knots from G292.0+1.8 were the subject of a proper motion analysis, based on [O III] 5007-Angstrom images taken over a 22-year baseline by Winkler et al. 2009 (arXiv:0810.1935). They determined that the transverse velocities of the filaments are linearly proportional to their distances from a common expansion center, thus the O-rich filaments have been traveling with little deceleration since the initial supernova event,about 3000 years ago. In this paper, we use optical spectra of G292.0+1.8, all taken from the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), to measure radial velocities for 93 knots. Assuming un-decelerated expansion, as indi- cated by the proper motions, the radial velocity should be proportional to the distance from the center along the line of sight, just as the proper motions are proportional to the transverse distance. Therefore, we can map the three-dimensional structure and kinematics of the SNR. We find that the knots generally follow a broad bi-conical distribution, suggesting that the supernova explosion produced broad jets of ejecta.

As in symmetric bounce models, the central curvature singularity inside the collapsing dust cloud is resolved. However, in contrast to the symmetric case, we find that a singularity emerges in the polymerised vacuum region during the bounce phase. This singularity can be identified as a shell-crossing singularity and exhibits the expected power-law behaviour of curvature scalars. Furthermore, likewise to the symmetric bounce models, we find a critical mass threshold governing the formation of inner and outer horizons in the pre-bounce phase.

Moreover, also the starburst ring of these sources is bright in the radio and hence, a potential source of $\u03b3$-rays and neutrinos.\n  We aim to explain the non-thermal features of these two sources with our homogeneous steady-state Seyfert-starburst composite model, which we refined in this work. Hereby, we account for stochastic diffuse acceleration and energy losses within the corona and $\u03b3\u03b3$-pair attenuation of the escaping $\u03b3$-rays. Since the non-thermal features of Seyfert sources contribute only marginally to the electromagnetic spectrum, only few data points can be assigned to the starburst ring or the AGN corona. Hence, prior information on the physical parameters is incorporated within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to avoid overfitting.\n  Based on this Bayesian parameter study we show, that the non-thermal features of NGC 1068 can be explained well. Still a more detailed treatment of the spatial inhomogeneities in the central region of the AGN could further improve the fit results.

Unfortunately, slow altitude drifts of the sodium layer compromise focus measurements, generating the so-called slow focus error, and, consequently, a natural guide star (NGS) is needed to compensate for that error. Our goal is to develop and operationalize a focal plane wavefront sensing (FPWFS) technique for slow focus tracking for the Keck I telescope, which can significantly increase sky coverage and allow slow focus tracking at higher frequencies, reducing the lag error. We develop, characterize, and compare three different FPWFS algorithms, namely Gerchberg-Saxton (GS), linearized focal plane technique (LiFT), and Gaussian fit (Gf). These algorithms were studied for the specific purpose of slow focus sensing in the NIR (H and K bands) using numerical simulations and data collected at Keck in 2025 (bench and on-sky). The three algorithms were studied and characterized against different criteria such as linearity, computational costs, and resistance to low signal-to-noise ratio and/or residuals. From the results obtained, the main candidate for an on-sky deployment was GS. On-sky tests showed promising results, with GS successfully compensating for purposely introduced focus errors, even under the presence of high turbulence conditions.

The distinction between these two subclasses is determined by the parameter $r_0$ that encodes relations between the external Maxwell field (given by the non-aligned components of the Faraday tensor ${\u03a6_0=\u03a6_2}$) and the Maxwell field created by the charge of the black hole (given by the aligned component $\u03a6_1$). Namely, if ${r_0=0}$ then the electromagnetic field is fully determined by ${\u03a6_0=\u03a6_2}$, and one gets the C-metric in the BR universe (including also the non-accelerating Schwarzschild-BR black hole). But if ${r_0\\neq 0}$ then the electromagnetic field is independently determined by both the external BR field and the field of a black hole itself, and this can be interpreted as the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole accelerating in the Bertotti-Robinson spacetime. Even though such an interpretation of the spacetime family is quite simple, it contains a lot of subtleties (e.g. the no-charge limit of the RN-BR spacetime, the non-trivial dependence on the signs of the mass and charge of a black hole, extreme black holes, and others) which we carefully investigate in this work.

Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The PSF characterizes how a point source, such as a star, is imaged after its light traverses the atmosphere and telescope optics, effectively representing the \"blurred fingerprint'' of the entire imaging system. Accurate PSF modeling is essential for weak gravitational lensing analyses, as biases in its estimation propagate directly into cosmic shear measurements -- one of the primary cosmological probes of the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of large-scale structure for dark energy studies. To address the limitations of PIFF, which constructs PSF models independently for each CCD and therefore loses spatial coherence across the focal plane, we introduce a deep-learning-based framework for PSF reconstruction. In this approach, an autoencoder is trained on stellar images obtained with the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) of the Subaru Telescope and combined with a Gaussian process to interpolate the PSF across the telescope's full field of view. This hybrid model captures systematic variations across the focal plane and achieves a reconstruction error of $3.4 \\times 10^{-6}$ compared to PIFF's $3.7 \\times 10^{-6}$, laying the foundation for integration into the LSST Science Pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The construction is based on a doubling of degrees of freedom and independent of a foliation. The action naturally decomposes into a bulk term furnishing Einstein's equations and a boundary term, which is related to conserved quantities, such as the Komar mass. We find that since only trivial connecting conditions must be specified on boundaries, the variational action principle for gravity as an initial value problem is rendered well-posed without the need to add additional boundary terms.

Using observational QPO data from stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black hole candidates, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis and obtain constraints on the black hole parameters. The results show that the presence of the quantum correction significantly affects the location of the QPO radii and the separation between the QPO orbit and the ISCO.

Even though the subsequent solutions namely, the Schwarzschild interior solution and the de Sitter solution are well known, the novelty of our presentation is that these solutions are shown to be a direct consequence of the imposed geometric constraints. The physical matter composition becomes highly constrained by the associated geometry under such conditions. The Schwarzschild interior solution describes the spacetime of an incompressible fluid sphere while the de Sitter solution corresponds to a vacuum energy dominated configuration. Interestingly, pressure anisotropy as well as `complexity factor' vanish identically once the Karmarkar's condition and the conformal flatness conditions are applied simultaneously.
