Our procedure -- which extends the work of Murata-Reall-Tanahashi to include charged scalar dynamics -- involves the fine-tuned scattering of wave packets within an initially super-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime. The resulting extremal solution develops an event horizon along which the energy density diverges and the charge density approaches a constant (i.e., the horizon forms with \"hair\"). We investigate this behavior from the perspective of critical phenomena in gravitational collapse, giving evidence that dynamical extremal black holes act as universal threshold solutions modulo this family-dependent hair. As in the linear instability of fixed extremal backgrounds, the scalar field decays outside the dynamical extremal horizon. But just inside the horizon, the scalar curvature appears to develop unbounded growth. This implies that near-threshold solutions without a black hole could develop correspondingly large curvatures visible from future null infinity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The advantage of the proposition is that the stellar structure equations are up to order two thus the theory is not haunted by ghosts. We obtain explicitly the defining equations for the thermodynamical variables and the geometry for the pure quadratic case since the linear case amounts to general relativity. In trying to establish the vacuum geometry associated with the theory it turns out that two possible metrics emerge through the vanishing of the energy-momentum tensor. Next we analyse the isotropy equation and make the observation that it is autonomous. It is rare that this happens in astrophysical modelling. This behaviour prompted the use of dynamical systems to understand the stability properties of fixed points or fixed manifolds. It was necessary to choose a gauge in order to split the autonomous equation into a system from which we could plot a phase portrait and deduce the stability of solution trajectories.

This work proposes DeepRed, a deep learning pipeline that demonstrates how modern computer vision architectures, including ResNet, EfficientNet, Swin Transformer, and MLP-Mixer, can estimate redshifts from images of galaxies, gravitational lenses, and gravitationally-lensed supernovae. We compare these architectures and their ensemble to both neural networks (A1, A3, NetZ, and PhotoZ) and a feature-based method (HOG+SVR) on simulated (DeepGraviLens) and real (KiDS, SDSS) datasets. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on all datasets. On DeepGraviLens, DeepRed achieves a significant improvement in the Normalized Mean Absolute Deviation compared to the best baseline (PhotoZ): 55% on DES-deep (using EfficientNet), 51% on DES-wide (Ensemble), 52% on DESI-DOT (Ensemble), and 46% on LSST-wide (Ensemble). On real observations from the KiDS survey, the pipeline outperforms the best baseline (NetZ), improving NMAD by 16% on a general test set without high-probability lenses (Ensemble) and 27% on high-probability lenses (Ensemble). For non-lensed galaxies in the SDSS dataset, the MLP-Mixer architecture achieves a 5% improvement over the best baselines (A3 and NetZ).

To this end, we simulate a comprehensive suite of gravitational-wave catalogs with full Bayesian parameter estimation and analyze them with parametric population models. For catalogs similar to GWTC-4, confident identification of a cutoff is not guaranteed, but GWTC-4 results are compatible with the best constraints among our simulations.

These transitions involve a systematic 1-2 keV drop in disc temperature and a pronounced hardening of the Comptonized component, with flux reductions of up to a factor of five. Using covariance spectra across 0.015-5 Hz, we show that the rapid coherent variability arises almost entirely from the disc, which exhibits strong energy-dependent variations, while the Comptonized component contributes minimally.

By parameterizing the azimuthal velocity as a fraction of the Keplerian value ($\u03be\\in [0,1]$), from purely radial infall ($\u03be=0$) to Keplerian rotation ($\u03be=1$), we examine the combined effects of radial compression and shear. Purely radial flows maximize amplification of both $B_r$ and $B_\u03b8$ due to strong compression. In rotating flows, a distinct dichotomy emerges: sub-Keplerian regimes ($\u03be<1$) preferentially enhance $B_r$, whereas Keplerian rotation strengthens $B_\u03b8$ via shear. The transition from subsonic outer regions to supersonic relativistic inner regions further accelerates magnetic growth, revealing effects absent in earlier analytical treatments.

Furthermore, the narrow ring width reported in the PRIMO image also confidently rules out emission increasing all the way down to the black hole horizon. Further assumptions on the mass of M87* and connections between the accretion disk cutoff and physical radii allow for rudimentary black hole spin estimates.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Motivated by studies of images produced by regular stars, it has been proposed that optical appearances caused by compact stars acting as gravitational lenses may account for this central bright spot. We further suggest that images produced by regular stars exhibit additional characteristics distinct from those of ordinary black holes, such as the possible partial or complete absence of secondary images. These phenomena may serve as favorable observational criteria for identifying regular stars in future searches.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Using a fully relativistic, compact accretion disk model with self-consistent inner-disk Comptonization, we reproduce the observed SED without significant residuals. The inferred black hole mass ${\\rm log}{10}(M{\\bullet}/M_\\odot) \\approx 6.0 \\pm 0.2$, and the inferred disk parameters place AT2024tvd within known TDE-disk scaling relations ($L_{\\rm bol}^{\\rm disk}/L_{\\rm Edd} \\propto T_{\\rm p}^4 \\propto M_{\\bullet}^{-1}$, $L_{\\rm plat} \\propto M_{\\bullet}^{2/3}$, $R_{\\rm out}/r_{\\rm g} \\propto M_{\\bullet}^{-2/3}$). Our results show that: (i) there is no \\textit{detected} star cluster or dwarf galaxy associated with the source, down to a mass limit of $\\log_{10}(M_{\\rm gal}/M_{\\odot}) \\leq 7.6$; (ii) the black hole is a wandering supermassive, rather than intermediate-mass, black hole; and (iii) the source represents an extreme case of black hole-to-host mass ratio, with $M_{\\bullet}/M_{\\rm gal} > 3\\%$, consistent with a heavily tidally stripped nucleus. The latter aligns with cosmological simulations predicting that surviving host remnants of most wandering black holes should not retain a detectable stellar overdensity when located at small halo-centric distances. We discuss differences with previous analyses of this source and highlight why our modeling approach provides a more physically consistent solution with more reliable parameter inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "Optical outburst spectra of low-mass X-ray binaries enable studies of extreme accretion and ejection phenomena. While some of their spectroscopic features have been analysed in detail, the appearance of broad absorptions in the optical regime has been traditionally neglected. In this work, we introduce the first population study dedicated to these features with the aim to understand their fundamental properties and discuss them in the context of their origin. We complement the study with a spectroscopic database of six low-mass X-ray binaries during outburst, in order to assess their evolution. We find that broad absorptions are ubiquitous, with the majority of black hole low-mass X-ray binaries exhibiting them in spite of a typically scarce outburst coverage. Their detection does not depend on the orbital inclination or the compact object nature, but they seem favoured in systems with orbital periods shorter than < 11 h. They predominantly occur in the hydrogen Balmer series, being stronger at shorter wavelengths, and they are detected across all X-ray states. We find that the normalised depth of these broad absorptions is anti-correlated with the system luminosity, and that they show constant line ratios over the whole sample. Based on these properties, we favour a scenario where BAs arise from a stable, optically thick layer of the accretion disc, below the hotter chromosphere-like region producing the emission line components. Our study is consistent with the continuous presence of broad absorptions during the whole outburst, with their visibility being conditioned by the emission lines filling the broad absorption profile and veiling by the X-ray reprocessed continuum.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
