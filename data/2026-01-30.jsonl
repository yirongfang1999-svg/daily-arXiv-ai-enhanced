Successful and choked jets, as well as the accretion disk, corona, wind, and outflow regions in a TDE have been examined and shown to produce TeV - PeV neutrinos. In this work, we use the IceCube 12.5 year high energy starting events (HESE) dataset and perform a maximum likelihood analysis to investigate the spatial and temporal correlations between HESE dataset and a selected sample of 89 TDEs. Our results indicate that the currently observed data do not show any significant correlation and hence is consistent with the background only hypothesis. Using this result, we place constraints on the fraction of TDEs harboring intrinsic jets ($f_{\\rm jet}$) and the corresponding isotropic-equivalent cosmic ray (CR) energy ($\\mathcal{E}_{\\rm CR}$). We note that even with limited statistics, we can constrain the parameter space as $\\mathcal{E}_{\\rm CR} \\lesssim 3 \\times 10^{53}$ erg for $f_{\\rm jet} \\gtrsim 0.6$ at more than 90% C.L. Finally, we discuss the theoretical implications of our results and the limits on the all-sky diffuse neutrino flux from TDEs. With more observational data in the electromagnetic band for TDEs and neutrino observations from IceCube and KM3NeT, our analysis can be used to place stringent constraints on physical parameters associated with TDEs."}

These fields likely arise from the turbulent amplification of initially weak magnetic fields during the merger, particularly via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the collisional interface between the stars. While previous studies have shown efficient amplification to magnetar-level strengths, the degree of large-scale coherence of the resulting field remains uncertain. We present general-relativistic, dynamical spacetime, magnetohydrodynamic simulations following the evolution of initially weak, pulsar-like magnetic fields in a binary neutron star merger. We find rapid magnetic field growth at small scales with clear signatures of small-scale turbulent dynamo action. At the highest resolutions, we additionally observe the emergence of coherent magnetic structures on larger scales. Our results imply that strong, ordered magnetic fields may be present immediately after merger, with important implications for the subsequent evolution of the remnant and its observable electromagnetic and gravitational-wave signals."}

In this formulation, the cosmological conformal factor is not a propagating degree of freedom but a global gauge variable fixed by the Hamiltonian constraint, rendering the conventional conformal-factor problem inapplicable. Thermal equilibrium at cosmological turning points uniquely fixes the equilibrium phase density ($Λ=R/6$) as the integrating factor that renders the horizon Clausius relation exact. Controlled departures from equilibrium are encoded by a single variance parameter governing non-adiabatic background evolution. The resulting framework clarifies the conceptual status of $Λ$CDM, explains the emergence of effective $w$CDM behavior--including phantom regimes without new degrees of freedom--and provides a natural origin for late-time cosmological tensions, arising from global constraints that preclude a stable de Sitter state."}

HWO will, for the first time, enable detailed studies of the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth-like exoplanets through high-contrast reflection spectroscopy across the UV, optical, and near-infrared. These wavelength ranges provide access to key molecular absorption features, including O2, O3, H2O, CO2, and CH4, as well as potential surface biosignatures such as the vegetation red edge or ocean glint, making HWO a cornerstone mission for assessing planetary habitability.\n  Clouds are a dominant factor in determining planetary climate and observability, yet their properties remain highly degenerate when constrained using reflected flux alone. Spectropolarimetry, a measure of the polarisation state of reflected light as a function of wavelength and orbital phase, provides a powerful complementary diagnostic. Polarisation is highly sensitive to cloud particle size, composition, shape, vertical distribution, and surface type, enabling degeneracies between atmospheric and surface models to be broken. Numerous studies have demonstrated the value of polarimetry for characterising a wide range of exoplanets, from hot Jupiters to cooler potentially habitable worlds.\n  HWO's proposed instrument suite includes a coronagraph, a high-resolution imager, and a candidate high-resolution spectropolarimeter, offering multiple pathways to exploit polarimetry across diverse planetary regimes. This white paper argues that incorporating polarimetric capability into HWO instruments would significantly enhance the mission's scientific return. We highlight the unique opportunity for UK leadership in both instrument development and theoretical modelling, and advocate for a strong UK role in shaping HWO's polarimetric capabilities to maximise its impact on exoplanet science."}

Jow", "Delon Shen"], "title": "Towards precision astrometry of scattered images of compact radio sources: scintillometry theory and prospects", "comment": null, "summary": "Compact radio sources such as pulsars and FRBs undergo scintillation in the interstellar medium (ISM) when scattered images interfere at the observer. ``Scintillometry'' refers to the range of techniques to extract astrometric information -- such as the angular positions of the images and distances to the scattering screen and source -- from scintillation observations. Pulsar scintillometry has proven to be a powerful technique, revealing rich and unexpected scattering phenomenology in the ISM and also shedding light on the emission physics of pulsars. FRB scintillometry stands to be a similarly powerful probe of FRB emission, as well as structure on tiny scales in ionized media beyond our galaxy, such as the circumgalactic medium (CGM). However, nascent FRB scintillation studies are far from the sophisticated lensing geometry reconstructions that have been performed for scintillating pulsars. In this paper, we introduce a novel theoretical framework for scintillometry, demonstrating that the full astrometric content of scintillation observations is contained within a single underlying observable: the instantaneous spatial wavefield. We relate the instantaneous spatial wavefield to more familiar concepts from the pulsar scintillometry literature, such as the dynamic spectrum. Using this framework, we discuss prospects and limitations for FRB scintillometry, towards the goal of full astrometric reconstructions of FRB lensing geometries. We show how key degeneracies in two-screen scattering measurements can be ameliorated. In addition, we discuss the possibility of inferring dispersion measure gradients across scintillation screens, which may shed light on the highly unconstrained physics of the cool CGM phase on tiny ($\\sim 100\\,{\\rm au}$) scales."}

Multiple physical mechanisms can contribute to the spectrum at these frequencies, including relativistic jets, the jet base, outflows, star formation, and synchrotron emission from the hot corona. Recently, new extreme radio variability has been observed in the class of low-mass/high-Eddington AGN known as narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies, suggesting that another, more exotic mechanism may also play a role, especially at frequencies above 10 GHz. To investigate this relatively unexplored area of the radio spectrum, we observed a sample of 50 NLS1s with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA), and 20 of them were observed twice. In this sample, 24 sources were not detected, while the others are typically characterized by a steep spectrum that can be modeled with a power law. We also identified two new candidate jetted NLS1s, including a high-frequency peaker, which is an extremely young relativistic jet. We found no significant variability in the sources observed twice. We conclude that the radio spectrum of NLS1s is typically dominated by optically thin emission, likely from low-power outflows, or by circumnuclear star formation, with a limited contribution from relativistic jets. Further studies at different spatial scales and at other wavelengths are necessary to fully constrain the origin of the radio emission in this class of active galaxies."}

In the canonical ensemble, we identify a critical electric charge $Q_c$ separating a regime exhibiting a first-order small/large black-hole (SBH/LBH) phase transition from a regime with a single thermodynamically stable phase. For both massless and massive probes, the thermal profile of the Lyapunov exponent $λ(T)$ becomes multivalued in the SBH/LBH coexistence region and exhibits a finite discontinuity at the transition temperature. This jump vanishes continuously as $Q \\to Q_c$, signaling the termination of the first-order transition at a second-order critical point. Near criticality, the Lyapunov discontinuity obeys a universal mean-field scaling law with critical exponent $1/2$. For massless probes, we further analyze the critical impact parameter $b_c$, which displays the same multivalued structure and critical behavior as the Lyapunov exponent. We also demonstrate that the spinodal temperatures, defined by the extrema of the $T(r_h)$ curve where the heat capacity at fixed charge diverges, coincide with singular features in the Lyapunov exponent. Our results identify the Lyapunov exponent as a unified dynamical probe capable of capturing both first-order phase coexistence and second-order critical behavior in black-hole thermodynamics."}

The instrument features NbTiN superconducting microstrip (MS) filters with low-loss a-SiC:H dielectric and an ultra-wideband leaky-wave antenna. A laboratory setup was designed, incorporating the cryostat housing cryogenic optics and ISS chip comprising 339 KIDs connected to MS filters tuned for (sub-)mm wave frequencies. Room-temperature mirrors on a hexapod stage allowed precise positioning and alignment of optical elements. The sky-position chopper was positioned on a motor-controlled stage for fine-tuned control over its position and alignment. Thanks to the multiplexing capability of KIDs, we could simultaneously measure multiple performance metrics across the entire frequency range. We showed that DESHIMA 2.0 achieved significant improvements in performance compared to its predecessor (DESHIMA 1.0): measured instantaneous frequency coverage was 200$-$400 GHz with a mean filter $Q_{filter}$ of $340 \\pm 50$; instrument efficiency reached $\\sim8$ \\%, indicating 4 times wider band coverage and 4 times higher sensitivity.

Villarroel and colleagues have assembled and analyzed datasets of unidentified features measured from digital scans of photographic plates captured by the first-epoch Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS1) in the pre-Sputnik era. These studies have called attention to (i) a purported deficit of features within Earth's shadow; (ii) the sporadic presence of linear clusters; and (iii) a positive correlation between the timing of feature observations and nuclear tests as well as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) sighting reports. These observations were cited as evidence that some fraction of the unidentified features represent glinting artificial objects near Earth. We have examined these claims using two related, previously published datasets. When analyzing the most vetted of these, we do not observe the reported deficit in the terrestrial shadow. We determine that a third of the features in the reported linear clusters were not confidently distinguished from catalog stars. We find that the reported correlation between the timing of feature observations and nuclear tests becomes insignificant after properly normalizing by the number of observation days, and is almost completely determined by the observation schedule of the Palomar telescope. We uncover important inconsistencies in the definitions of the datasets used in these studies, as well as the use of unvalidated datasets containing catalog stars, scan artifacts, and plate defects. It has not been shown that any of the features in these datasets represent optical transients. We examine the spatial distribution of the plate-derived features, finding an overall gradual increase in number density toward the corners and edges of plates, as well as examples of (i) empty north-south strips that span multiple plates; (ii) clusters and voids having geometric shapes; and (iii) amorphous clusters."}

Considering two plausible scenarios, AGN jets and winds, we model the X-ray, GeV, and TeV emission during both TeV-low (quasi-quiet) and TeV-high (active) states. The spectral energy distributions can be explained either by single-zone leptonic emission from moderately relativistic jets or by lepto-hadronic emission from sub-relativistic winds. The best-fit parameters suggest that the transition from the quasi-quiet to the active state may be driven jointly by an enhanced accretion rate and the expansion of jets or winds. We further show that future MeV and very-high-energy $γ$-ray observations can discriminate between the {leptonic and lepto-hadronic scenarios}. Although the neutrino flux from NGC~1068 predicted by the wind model is too low to be detected with current neutrino observatories, a lepto-hadronic wind scenario can account for the PeV diffuse neutrino background when adopting a local LLAGN density corrected for the TeV duty cycle, $n_{\\rm L,0}(ΔT_{\\rm TeV}/T) \\sim 10^{-5}~\\rm Mpc^{-3}$, as inferred from the LHAASO detection."}

We perform reverberation modelling of the 3--50 keV lag-energy spectra using the general relativistic transfer function code, which provides independent timing-based measurements of the black hole mass $M_{\\rm BH}=1.37_{-0.36}^{+0.33}\\times10^8~M_{\\odot}$ and the coronal height $h=2.45_{-2.36}^{+1.92}~R_{\\rm g}$ (with uncertainties at 90\\% confidence). Within the uncertainties, the measured mass is found to be consistent with the previous finding. Furthermore, we undertake reflection spectroscopy to account for the hump feature and the associated relativistic effect using the time-averaged flux spectrum. Further sampling of the {\\it NuSTAR} data (with a bin width of 0.2/0.4 keV below and above 10 keV) that reshapes the spectral resolution allows us to constrain the coronal temperature at $50.26_{-4.03}^{+5.58}$ keV -- consistent with the previous result from the combined {\\it Suzaku} and {\\it NuSTAR} data."}

We interpreted the high-energy emission of PSR J1813-1246 using the synchro-curvature (SC) radiation model and tested whether the gamma-ray spectral energy distribution (SED) of HESS J1813-126 can be explained as a pulsar halo powered by PSR J1813-1246.

Quantum fluctuations in the particle motion and in the field prevent signaling or violations of quantum mechanics in this setup. We reformulate this thought experiment by considering gravitational waves emitted by an extended quadrupolar object as a detector for Newtonian tidal fields. We find that quantum fluctuations in the gravitational waves prevent signaling. In the Newtonian limit, rotating black holes behave as extended quadrupolar objects, as consequence of the strong equivalence principle. It follows that consistency of the Newtonian limit of general relativity with quantum mechanics requires the quantization of gravitational radiation, even when the waves originate in strong gravity sources."}

Identifying such lensed pairs, however, remains challenging due to the computational cost and/or the reliance on prior knowledge of source parameters in existing methods. This study investigates a novel approach, Optimal Cross-Correlation Analysis for Multiplets (OCCAM), applied to strain data from one or more detectors for Compact Binary Coalescence (CBC) events identified by GW searches, using an optimal, mildly model-dependent, low computation cost approach to identify strongly lensed candidates. This technique efficiently narrows the search space, allowing for more sensitive, but (much) higher latency, algorithms to refine the results further. We demonstrate that our method performs significantly better than other computationally inexpensive methods. In particular, we achieve 97 percent (80 percent) lensed event detection at a pairwise false positive probability of approximately 13 percent (7 percent) for a single detector with LIGO design sensitivity, assuming an SNR greater than or equal to 10 astrophysically motivated lensed and unlensed populations. Thus, this method, using a network of detectors and in conjunction with sky-localisation information, can enormously reduce the false positive probability, making it highly viable to efficiently and quickly search for lensing pairs among thousands of events, including the sub-threshold candidates."}

Both precursors and main bursts have durations and hardness broadly consistent with Type II GRBs. However, precursors show longer MVTs (by factors of 3-10) and diverse lags with near-zero median values, while main bursts display variable MVTs and positive lags. These differences suggest precursors may originate from distinct dissipation conditions, possibly due to cocoon shock breakout or early magnetically dominated outflows. Despite temporal differences, both episodes are consistent with a single collapsar origin, providing no evidence for dual-progenitor events. Our findings support pulse-resolved classification and show that precursors offer critical insights into jet formation and pre-burst activity."}

Still, they come with limitations imposed by finite computing power, whose impact is not straightforward to evaluate a priori. Observational features are hence required as verification. energy electrons accelerated at external shocks, provides a testbed for such predictions. Current numerical studies suggest that in GRB afterglows the maximum synchrotron photon energy, which corresponds to the limit of electron acceleration, may fall within the $\\sim$ 0.1--10 keV X-ray energy band at late times, $t\\gtrsim 10^6 - 10^7$ s. To test this prediction, we analyzed the X-ray spectra of six GRBs with \\emph{Swift}/XRT detections beyond $10^7$ s: our analysis reveals no clear evidence of a spectral cutoff. Using a model that accounts for the effect of the finite opening angle of the shock on the observed maximum synchrotron photon energy, we show that these observations are incompatible with PIC simulation predictions, unless one or more physical afterglow parameters attain values at odds with those typically inferred from afterglow modeling (small radiative efficiency, low ambient density, large equipartition fraction $ε_{\\rm B}$ of the magnetic field). These findings challenge existing numerical simulation results and imply a more efficient acceleration of electrons to high-energies than seen in PIC simulations, with important implications for our understanding of particle acceleration in relativistic shocks."}

As we demonstrate in a very detailed manner, this is impossible for a canonical and minimally coupled single scalar field theory, but it may be possible for ghost condensate theories like $k$-essence theories. We point out how the ghost instabilities may be eliminated, and we analyze the quantitative features of a $k$-essence theory that may realize a phantom-to-quintessence transition in the late Universe. We also qualitatively compare the difficulties and fine-tunings required for $k$-essence theories to realize a phantom-to-quintessence transition, and how such a transition is naturally realized in modified gravity, without unnecessary fine-tunings and ghost eliminations."}

Bayesian fitting of GEV models to block maxima of peak flux and fluence data reveals FRB 20250316A to be a profound statistical outlier. For the peak flux, the analysis yields a return period of $\\sim$ 600 years ($1σ$ credible level), with the underlying distribution being of the heavy-tailed, unbounded Fréchet type ($ξ> 0$). The fluence analysis indicates greater complexity: while the full sample suggests a Fréchet-type distribution with a $\\sim50$-year return period in $1σ$ credible level, the removal of three other notable outliers points toward a light-tailed Weibull-type distribution ($ξ< 0$) with a finite upper bound far exceeded by FRB 20250316A. This dichotomy highlights the challenge in characterizing the tail of the FRB luminosity function with limited data. Although less extreme in recurrence time than the ``Brightest Of All Time'' gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A, FRB 20250316A constitutes a similarly exceptional event (a potential FRB ``BOAT'') within the short observational history of wide-field radio surveys.

In this article we study a combined framework of a tachyonic minimally coupled single scalar field theory in the presence of an $\\mathcal{R}^2$ correction term and with a rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term of the form $\\sim λ\\frac{\\mathcal{R}}{16πG}$. Such terms can be part of an $f(\\mathcal{R})$ gravity which in the large curvature regime yields such correction terms effectively. Alternatively, such terms can simply be quantum corrections to the scalar field action. We aim to answer two questions, firstly if this framework can lead to phantom divide line transitions and secondly whether the resulting model can be compatible with the ACT data. The model we studied is an inverse square power-law model, well known from tachyon inflation models. As we show, the field equations can be cast in terms of the scalar field solely, however the resulting theory is distinct from a single scalar field theory, because the phantom divide line is crossed during inflation. Thus initially the tachyonic nature of the scalar field generates a phantom equation of state parameter, and during inflation the phantom divide line is crossed, with the effective equation of state parameter at the end of inflation being $w=-1/3$ which corresponds to the non-accelerating state of the Universe. The model is proved to be compatible with the ACT data, only when the gravity during inflation is stronger than Einstein-Hilbert gravity, with the effective gravitational constant during inflation being $\\frac{G}λ$. The effective theory is valid only during inflation, thus Big-Bang nucleosynthesis is not affected by the rescaling of the Einstein-Hilbert gravity. The feature of a phantom crossing in $f(\\mathcal{R},φ)$ frameworks is new in the literature."}

Importantly, we show that the performance gain provided by our method scales with SNR, establishing it as a powerful technique to mitigate the cost of analysing signals from current and future gravitational-wave observatories."}

By incorporating such terms alongside a minimally coupled scalar field, we discover three distinct dynamical phases near the singularity: modified Kasner eons, persistent periodic oscillations, and oscillatory spike dynamics with growing amplitude. In particular, the Kasner-like geometry persisting only in highly constrained situations. The latter two regimes represent a clean departure from classical Kasner phenomenology, revealing a richer and more ordered landscape of behaviors in the deep interior of black holes beyond Einstein gravity. This work establishes a comprehensive approach for understanding the gravitational nonlinearity in the most extreme gravitational environment."}

Identifying such lensed pairs, however, remains challenging due to the computational cost and/or the reliance on prior knowledge of source parameters in existing methods. This study investigates a novel approach, Optimal Cross-Correlation Analysis for Multiplets (OCCAM), applied to strain data from one or more detectors for Compact Binary Coalescence (CBC) events identified by GW searches, using an optimal, mildly model-dependent, low computation cost approach to identify strongly lensed candidates. This technique efficiently narrows the search space, allowing for more sensitive, but (much) higher latency, algorithms to refine the results further. We demonstrate that our method performs significantly better than other computationally inexpensive methods. In particular, we achieve 97 percent (80 percent) lensed event detection at a pairwise false positive probability of approximately 13 percent (7 percent) for a single detector with LIGO design sensitivity, assuming an SNR greater than or equal to 10 astrophysically motivated lensed and unlensed populations. Thus, this method, using a network of detectors and in conjunction with sky-localisation information, can enormously reduce the false positive probability, making it highly viable to efficiently and quickly search for lensing pairs among thousands of events, including the sub-threshold candidates."}

These are the so called bulk flows, the presence of which has come to be treated as a problem for the $Λ$CDM paradigm. However, the limits of the $Λ$CDM model are based on Newtonian studies, which predict the mediocre $v\\propto t^{1/3}$ growth-rate for the peculiar-velocity field ($v$). Recently, a few fully relativistic treatments have appeared in the literature, arguing for a much stronger velocity growth that could explain the reported fast and deep bulk flows. What separates the Newtonian from the relativistic studies is the gravitational input of the peculiar flux, namely of the kinetic energy triggered by the moving matter. The latter has no direct gravitational contribution in Newtonian theory, but it does so in general relativity. This drastically changes the driving agent of the peculiar-velocity field and boosts its linear growth. The aim of this work is to directly compare the two treatments, as well as identify and discuss the reasons for their different results. In the process, we also demonstrate how one could recover the relativistic growth-rate from a Newtonian setup by selectively including certain (typically ignored) source-free terms into the Poisson equation. This way, we provide a unified covariant comparison of the Newtonian, the quasi-Newtonian and the fully relativistic studies."}

Our framework introduces scattering maps prescribed on two classes of hypersurfaces: a gravitational singularity hypersurface and a fluid-discontinuity hypersurface. By analyzing the causal structures induced by the light cone and the acoustic cone, we formulate a local evolution problem for the Einstein-Euler system in the presence of such interfaces. We explain how suitable scattering relations must supplement the field equations in order to ensure uniqueness and thus yield a complete macroscopic description of the evolution. This viewpoint builds on a theory developed in collaboration with G. Veneziano for quiescent (velocity-dominated) singularities in solutions of the Einstein equations coupled to a scalar field, where the passage across the singular hypersurface is encoded by a singularity scattering map. The guiding question is to identify junction prescriptions that are compatible with the Einstein and Euler equations, in particular with the propagation of constraints. The outcome is a rigid set of universal relations, together with a family of model-dependent parameters. Under physically motivated requirements (general covariance, causality, constraint compatibility, and ultra-locality), we aim to classify admissible scattering relations arising from microscopic physics and characterizing, at the macroscopic level, the dynamics of a fluid coupled to Einstein gravity."}

Specifically, we primarily focus on holographic quantum BTZ black holes, dual to $(3+1)$-dimensional accelerating black holes in anti-de Sitter space that localize on Karch-Randall end-of-the-world (ETW) branes. To derive their horizon thermodynamics, we regulate the bulk Euclidean geometry by adding a second ETW brane at asymptotic spatial infinity. We compute the on-shell action of the complexified accelerating black hole in the grand canonical ensemble and derive the quantum BTZ black hole thermodynamics, where the thermal entropy is equal to the generalized entropy. This provides a first principles derivation of the generalized entropy of three-dimensional quantum black holes. Further, we construct charged and rotating quantum black holes in three-dimensional de Sitter and Minkowski space using Randall-Sundrum ETW branes, and compute their horizon thermodynamics."}

We analyze the algebraic structure, finding the spacetime to be generically of Petrov type I, and investigate the equatorial dynamics of charged test particles and photons. Our analysis reveals that the external magnetic field $b$ induces a ``Lorentz shift'' in the effective angular momentum, suppressing the potential barrier and causing the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) to migrate inward. In contrast, the radius of the photon ring shifts slightly outward with increasing magnetization."}

Using adaptive mesh refinement to resolve the bubble wall, we identify three dynamical outcomes: type B (supercritical) PBHs with an interior baby universe and a bifurcating trapping horizon, type A (subcritical) PBHs with an apparent horizon formed by direct wall collapse, and dispersal with no PBH formation. To separate these three cases, we evaluate two commonly used PBH-formation criteria: the time scale ratio $t_\\mathrm{H}/t_\\mathrm{V}$ (horizon crossing time versus vacuum-energy domination time) and the local density contrast $δ(t_\\mathrm{H})$ at horizon crossing. For the parameter space explored, we find that $t_\\mathrm{H}/t_\\mathrm{V}$ is a more robust predictor of outcome: type B PBHs form when $t_\\mathrm{H}/t_\\mathrm{V} \\gtrsim 1$ (critical range $\\sim 1.1 - 1.6$ in our survey), type A PBHs arise when $t_\\mathrm{H}/t_\\mathrm{V}$ is below this threshold but remains above a lower bound (typical range $\\sim 0.35 - 0.7$), and no-PBH dispersal occurs when $t_\\mathrm{H}/t_\\mathrm{V}$ falls below this lower bound. When a clear thin-wall FVD boundary exists, $δ(t_\\mathrm{H})$ can correspondingly distinguish different outcomes (roughly $δ_c(t_\\mathrm{H}) \\sim 1 - 1.7$ for type B and $δ_c(t_\\mathrm{H}) \\sim 0.35 - 0.5$ for type A), but is highly sensitive to wall structure and model details and thus less universal. These results offer new insights into the dynamics of FVD collapse, quantify practical PBH-formation thresholds, and pave the way for precise predictions of PBH abundance from delayed FOPTs."}

We show that these different components match the Green's function numerically obtained by solving a time-domain Regge-Wheeler code. In addition, the components of the Green's function also agree with earlier studies in Schwarzschild spacetime with small cosmological constant. The identification of all the various parts of the Schwarzschild Green's function represents an important step towards analyzing direct waves and quasinormal modes in the ringdown stage of binary black hole coalescence, as well as their nonlinear interaction near the merger."}

These fields likely arise from the turbulent amplification of initially weak magnetic fields during the merger, particularly via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the collisional interface between the stars. While previous studies have shown efficient amplification to magnetar-level strengths, the degree of large-scale coherence of the resulting field remains uncertain. We present general-relativistic, dynamical spacetime, magnetohydrodynamic simulations following the evolution of initially weak, pulsar-like magnetic fields in a binary neutron star merger. We find rapid magnetic field growth at small scales with clear signatures of small-scale turbulent dynamo action. At the highest resolutions, we additionally observe the emergence of coherent magnetic structures on larger scales. Our results imply that strong, ordered magnetic fields may be present immediately after merger, with important implications for the subsequent evolution of the remnant and its observable electromagnetic and gravitational-wave signals."}
