We begin with a general metric-affine scalar-tensor action that is linear in curvature and contains all operators that are at most quadratic in the covariant second derivatives of the scalar field, ensuring that the connection enters only through curvature and through these second derivatives. Solving the connection equation by performing a full decomposition of the distortion tensor gives a closed-form effective metric theory. Imposing the standard metric DHOST degeneracy conditions then selects a Palatini Class Ia branch that is fully determined by two free functions in the original action. Analyzing the tensor sector shows that requiring gravitational waves to propagate at the speed of light further restricts the theory to a one-function family. These results provide a detailed and self-contained characterization of the quadratic metric-affine Class Ia sector within this operator basis and identify the theoretical conditions implied by gravitational wave observations."}

If at least one of $ε_1$, $ε_2$ is zero, massless Majorana spinors can be solved explicitly. If $ε_1$, $ε_2$ are nonzero, we prove the nonexistence of massless time-periodic Majorana spinors in the non-extreme Kerr spacetime which are $L^p$ outside the event horizon for $ 0<p\\le\\frac{6}{|ε_1|+|ε_2| +2}$.

This paper presents a new, likelihood-based approach to derive the gain from images taken up-the-ramp, where the detector is read out nondestructively many times before being reset. Our method makes full use of the individual reads assuming an ideal detector subject to photon noise and Gaussian read noise. We extend the method to account for slight nonlinearities in the relation between photoelectrons and measured counts. We demonstrate that our likelihood-based approach provides a consistent (i.e. asymptotically correct) and nearly unbiased estimator of the gain both with and without fitting for nonlinearity. Finally, we apply this approach to a single detector from the Wide-Field Instrument on the Roman Space Telescope, and show how pixel-to-pixel gain variations describe much of the variations in pixel response seen in flatfield images.

Abstract shortened with respect to the manuscript. Accepted in Astronomy & Astrophysics", "summary": "We investigate the presence and spatial characteristics of the jet base emission in M87* at 230 GHz, enabled by the enhanced uv coverage in the 2021 Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations. The addition of the 12-m Kitt Peak Telescope and NOEMA provides two key intermediate-length baselines to SMT and the IRAM 30-m, giving sensitivity to emission structures at scales of $\\sim250~μ$as and $\\sim2500~μ$as (0.02 pc and 0.2 pc). Without these baselines, earlier EHT observations lacked the capability to constrain emission on large scales, where a \"missing flux\" of order $\\sim1$ Jy is expected. To probe these scales, we analyzed closure phases, robust against station-based gain errors, and modeled the jet base emission using a simple Gaussian offset from the compact ring emission at separations $>100~μ$as. Our analysis reveals a Gaussian feature centered at ($Δ$RA $\\approx320~μ$as, $Δ$Dec $\\approx60~μ$as), a projected separation of $\\approx5500$ AU, with a flux density of only $\\sim60$ mJy, implying that most of the missing flux in previous studies must arise from larger scales. Brighter emission at these scales is ruled out, and the data do not favor more complex models. This component aligns with the inferred direction of the large-scale jet and is consistent with emission from the jet base. While our findings indicate detectable jet base emission at 230 GHz, coverage from only two intermediate baselines limits reconstruction of its morphology. We therefore treat the recovered Gaussian as an upper limit on the jet base flux density. Future EHT observations with expanded intermediate-baseline coverage will be essential to constrain the structure and nature of this component."}

The most realistic model would be a hot magnetized plasma. In such a medium, however, an analytical description of light rays is very difficult. Therefore, usually an isotropic dispersive medium is assumed in analytical calculations. While it is possible to formulate equations for a general refractive index, which some studies do, most attention in the literature is given to the particular case of a cold, non-magnetized electron-ion plasma. Whereas this model covers many astrophysically relevant situations, there are indications that in some cases the plasma temperature is so high that the approximation of a cold plasma is no longer valid. For this reason, we consider in this paper a warm, non-magnetized electron-ion plasma, where the temperature is not set equal to zero but assumed to be small enough, such that relevant equations can be linearized with respect to it. After discussing the general equations for light rays in such a medium on a general-relativistic spacetime, we specify to the axially symmetric and stationary case which includes the spherically symmetric and static case. In particular, we calculate the influence of a warm plasma on the bending angle. In the spherically symmetric and static case, we also calculate the shadow in a warm plasma. We illustrate the general results with a static (respectively corotating) and an infalling warm plasma on Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes."}

The algorithm operates simultaneously on many nondestructive ramps at a range of count rates and directly computes the function transforming measured counts into linearized counts. We also compute chi squared for the corrected ramps, enabling the user to identify the polynomial degree beyond which chi squared ceases to improve significantly. The computational cost of our algorithm is linear in the number of reads and ramps, reaching ~100 hours to derive a correction for all 4096 x 4096 pixels of a Hawaii-4 RG detector from 186 illuminated 55-read ramps on a 2023 Macbook Pro laptop (~10,000 reads per pixel). We identify a potential source of bias in the nonlinearity correction when combining ramps of very different illuminations, together with effective mitigations. We apply our algorithm to a random set of pixels from the Roman Space Telescope's Wide Field Instrument. We find that a >=9th order nonlinearity correction is needed, at which point chi squared is close to its theoretically expected value and beyond which chi squared improves little with increasing polynomial order.

Submitted to The Open Journal of Astrophysics. Comments welcome", "summary": "We present a simple time-dependent model of viscously spreading accretion disks around black holes (BHs) with masses between $10-10^8M_\\odot$. We apply the results to observations of late-time emission in tidal disruption events (TDEs) and luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOT) such as AT2018cow. Our model generalizes previous work by incorporating outflows during super-Eddington accretion, non-conservation of mass and angular momentum in TDE circularization, irradiation of the outer disk by the inner accretion flow, and a range of viscous stress models. We show that many late-time plateaus in TDEs can be explained by disks formed with a large spread in angular momentum due to redistribution during circularization. Viscous spreading on year timescales is not required, although it is also compatible with the data. The collapse of radiation pressure dominated thin disks to the stable gas-pressure dominated phase greatly underpredicts TDE plateau luminosities, strongly favoring thermally stable magnetically dominated disk models. Irradiation of the outer disk in TDEs due to misalignment of the stellar orbit and black hole spin increases plateau luminosities and durations by factors of a few. Continued study of late-time TDE emission provides a unique opportunity to constrain the physics of disk formation and circularization, disk warps, angular momentum transport, and other poorly understood aspects of disk physics. The models we develop can also explain the late-time optical-UV emission in the LFBOT AT2018cow for BH masses of ~$10-100M_\\odot$. The faint X-ray emission at late times in AT2018cow is likely due to ongoing absorption. Our models predict that late-time X-rays should eventually be detectable again, and that HST/JWST observations of AT2018cow may detect a break in the SED at near-IR-optical wavelengths, providing a powerful probe of outer accretion disk thermodynamics."}

As key tracers of hierarchical structure formation, subhalos are among the most important objects within these simulations. In our previous work, we established that the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) can effectively extract clustering information and serve as a robust halo finder. Here, we extend the CWT framework to subhalo identification by adapting the CWTHF (Continuous Wavelet Transform Halo Finder) code. This extension extends the unbinding procedure, which enables the reliable identification of gravitationally bound substructures. The algorithm identifies density peaks within known halos or subhalos and segments the surrounding volume accordingly. Once a new subhalo is registered, its position is recorded to prevent duplicate detection. We validate our approach using the TNG50-2 and TNG100-1 simulations, as well as a single Friends-of-Friends (FOF) halo, by comparing the resulting CWT catalog against the reference SUBFIND catalog. Because the method inherits the original computational framework, our subhalo finder maintains a favorable linear time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(N)$."}

Here, we propose a new theoretical framework for this problem, based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. In this model, coronal variability arises from feedback between a macroscopic oscillation of the plasma and the rate at which it is cooled by the inverse Compton scattering of soft photons from the disc. The \"pair thermostat'' mechanism then allows the corona to act as a heat engine that extracts work cyclically from the underlying thermal disequilibrium between the low-entropy heating and the high-entropy cooling by the soft photons, in close analogy to the well-known $κ$-mechanism for pulsating stars. This coronal self-oscillation may explain QPOs without the need to invoke an external resonant driving. Moreover, we argue that this mechanism can provide the power to generate turbulence and jets in the corona."}

For the Eddington--inspired Born--Infeld (EiBI) theory we show that the connection can be solved algebraically as well, and that its determinantal field equations produce a parallel Neumann expansion with coefficients fixed by the underlying determinant operator. This allows us to rewrite the Einstein--like equations in the auxiliary metric as an effective Einstein equation for $g_{μν}$ with a local algebraic correction $(ΔT)_{μν}$ that follows from a dual EFT built from the invariants $\\{T,\\,T^2,\\,T_{μν}T^{μν},\\ldots\\}$, organised by a characteristic density scale. We prove a convergence criterion based on the spectral radius of $\\hat T^μ_ν$ and interpret EiBI gravity as a determinantal resummation of the same $T$--tower. Extending the framework to symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity, we identify the EFT coefficients in terms of $f_Q$ and $f_{QQ}$ and present a background matching for $f(Q)=Q+αQ^2$.

The transient occurred at a projected offset of $\\sim 40$ kpc from its spiral-galaxy host. We consider two explanations for this large distance: (i) NSs that merge inside a remote globular cluster, or (ii) a BNS that formed in the disk whose orbit was strongly modified by the NS natal kicks. Using JWST data and comparisons with known globular clusters, we show that a globular-cluster origin is extremely unlikely, ruling out case (i). Considering case (ii), using JWST and MUSE data, we derive the host galaxy morphology, stellar mass, estimate the atomic gas (HI+He) contribution, and the host rotation curve. Assuming an NFW halo and applying Bayesian inference, we obtain a mass model for the host galaxy. From this model, we compute the time required for a disk-formed BNS, with a given natal kick, to reach the observed offset while marginalizing over uncertainties and over the initial position in the disk. We compare these results with BNS-merger simulations from the SEVN population-synthesis code combined with PARSEC stellar evolutionary tracks, which provide the coalescence time and kick velocity for each realization. The two approaches have an overlap in the kick-time diagram, but only 0.1\\% of the simulated systems fall within the 2$σ$ region of the galaxy mass model.

A common remedy assumes that $M_0$ coincides with the actual mass of the star $M_S$; however, this approximation is only adequate for very slow rotation (when the dimensionless spin parameter is $χ_S<0.1$). The more accurate alternative approach, based on the $I$-Love-$Q$-$δM$ set of relations, circumvents this limitation by enabling the inference of $M_0$. Here we review both approaches and provide numerical comparisons."}

Despite its significance, a systematic characterisation of the statistical properties of the X-ray variability to the highest Eddington ratios and most massive black holes is still lacking. In this paper we address this issue using SRG/eROSITA 5-epoch light curves to characterise the mean X-ray variability of optically selected SDSS QSOs extending to black holes masses of $10^{10}$ solar and accretion rates close to the Eddington limit. The adopted variability statistic is the ensemble normalised excess variance, which is measured using a novel hierarchical Bayesian model (eBExVar) tailored to the Poisson nature of the X-ray light curves. We find a clear anti-correlation of the ensemble variability with black hole mass, extending previous results to time scales of months. This can be interpreted as evidence for an X-ray corona size and/or physical conditions that scale with black holes mass. We also find an unexpected increase of the ensemble normalised excess variance close to the Eddington limit, which is contrary to the predictions of empirical variability models. This result suggests an additional variability component for fast growing black holes that may be related to systematic variations of the hot corona size with Eddington ratio or shielding of the hot corona by an inner puffed-up disk and/or outflows."}

Using EEH geometry, we compute the structure of circular motion, the effective potential and force, and we evaluate the orbital, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies together with the Lense-Thirring and periastron precession rates. Our calculations show that, compared to the Kerr model, the charge parameter $Q$ and the spin parameter $a$ significantly modify the strong gravitational field and shift the characteristic frequencies. We then model the dynamical structure formed by matter accreting toward the EEH black hole through the BHL mechanism, finding that the parameter $Q$ increases the amount of infalling matter and strengthens shock-cone instabilities near the horizon, while farther from the black hole it suppresses accretion and reduces turbulence. Time-series analysis of the accretion rate reveals robust QPOs, whose low-frequency components arise from the precession of the shock cone, while high-frequency components appear as a consequence of strong-field instabilities modified by $Q$ and $a$. A systematic parameter-space exploration identifies the regions where EEH corrections maximize QPO activity, indicating that nonlinear electrodynamics can leave observable imprints on accretion flows and may be testable with QPO and horizon-scale observations."}

The underlying physical processes that produce the evolution of their X-ray emission and their long-lasting UV/optical plateau are well understood; however, the origin of their early-time optical/UV emission remains the subject of much debate and uncertainty. In this paper we propose and perform ``Calorimetric'' tests of published theories of these optical flares, contrasting theoretical predictions for the scaling of the radiated energy and peak luminosity of these flares with black hole mass (something which is predicted by each theory), with the observed (positive) black hole mass scaling. No one theory provides a satisfactory description of observations at all black hole mass scales. Theories relating to the reprocessing of an Eddington-limited compact accretion disk, or emission (energy) released in the formation of a Keplerian disk near the circularisation radius, perform best, but require extending. Models whereby the optical/UV flare are directly produced by shocks between debris streams (e.g., TDEmass), or the efficient reprocessing of the fallback rate (e.g., MOSFIT, or any other model in which $L \\propto \\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{fb}}$), are ruled out at high $(>5σ)$ significance by the data."}

By solving this equation numerically, we analyse both physical and geometric properties of these charged fluid spheres for different values of $n$ and $Γ$. By imposing subluminal sound speeds and energy conditions, we restrict ourselves to configurations that are physically acceptable. Then, within these physical models, we study internal trapping of circular geodesics and find the trapping regions in the $n$-$Γ$ parameter space. Going beyond the traditionally studied case of null geodesics, we consider orbits of charged and/or massive particles. We show that for neutral null particles (and only for them), their trapping depends purely on the properties of the space-time. In the other three cases, properties such as the particle's own charge and/or energy also play a role. In general, we find that trapping of all types of particles is allowed for a broad range of $n$ and $Γ$."}

Even the narrow component of the line is resolved with evident Fe K$α_{1}$ (6.404 keV) and K$α_{2}$ (6.391 keV) contributions in a 2:1 flux ratio, fully consistent with a neutral gas with negligible bulk velocity.

In this paper, we take the simplest approach to model the asymmetric line as a single emission line (assuming either neutral, He-like or H-like iron) convolved with a relativistic disk line model. As expected, the inferred inclination angle is highly sensitive to the assumed ionization state, and ranges between $i=17-44^{ \\circ}$. This model also constrains the black hole spin via the extent of the red wing: the required gravitational redshift in the fitted disk-line profile disfavors a non-spinning (Schwarzschild) black hole. The derived inner radius is close to the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit $r_{\\rm ISCO}$ and strongly correlated with the black hole spin. To better constrain the spin, we fix the inner radius at $r_{\\rm ISCO}$ and derive a lower limit on the spin of $a \\ge 0.29$ at the 3 $σ$ confidence level.

The corresponding images are directly affected not only by the background space-time geometry but also by the physics of the accretion disk, whose combination yields a characteristic fingerprint. In this paper, we consider such a fingerprint for objects which are not asymptotically flat but instead approach a Anti-de Sitter space-time. This assumption significantly influences light trajectories and, consequently, the corresponding images of the objects as seen by an observer at some distance, which can be used in future VLBI observations for testing alternatives of this kind to the Kerr paradigm. We illustrate our considerations with the examples of a Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter black hole and a black string, discussing their most notable departures from canonical, asymptotically-flat black hole space-times."}

A key concern arises if these stellar-mass binary black holes reside in gaseous environments such as active galactic nucleus accretion disks, where environmental effects imprint detectable modulations on the gravita- tional waveform. Using Bayesian inference on simulated signals containing both environmental and dipole deviation, we have assessed the extent to which the presence of environmental effects affects the detectability of dipole radiation. Our results demonstrate that even in the presence of strong environmental coupling, the dipole parameter can be recovered with high precision, and the evidence for dipole radiation remains distinguishable. Crucially, we find that the existence of environmental effects does not fundamentally impede the identification of dipole radiation, provided both effects are simultaneously modelled in the inference process. This study establishes that future tests of modified gravity with space-borne observatories can remain robust even for sources in astrophysical environments."}

Observations suggest nulling is prevalent in many long-period pulsars and must be understood to obtain a more comprehensive picture of pulsar emission and its evolution. One of the limitations in observational characterisation of nulling is the limited signal-to-noise, making individual pulses often not easily distinguishable from noise or any putative faint emission. Although some of the approaches in the published literature attempt to address this, they lose efficacy when individual pulses appear indistinguishable from the noise, and as a result, can lead to less accurate measurements. Here we develop a new method (the $\\mathbb{N}$sum algorithm) that uses sums of pulses for better distinguishability from noise and thus measures the nulling fraction more robustly. It can be employed for measuring nulling fractions in weaker pulsars and observations with a limited number of observed pulses. We compare our algorithm with the recently developed Gaussian Mixture Modelling approach, using both simulated and real data, and find that our approach yields consistent results for generic and weaker pulsars. We also explore quasi-periodicity in nulling and measure the related parameters for five pulsars, including PSRs~J1453$-$6413, J0950$+$0755 and J0026$-$1955, for which these are also the first such measurements.

The pulsar exhibits a radio spectrum of the form $S_ν\\propto ν^α$, with a measured spectral index of $α= -1.8(3)$. It is eclipsed for 42% of its orbit at 888 MHz, and multi--frequency image--domain observations show that the egress duration scales with frequency as a power law with index $n = -1.74$, where longer duration eclipses are seen at lower frequencies. An optical counterpart is detected in archival Gaia data within $0.5''$ of the radio position.

In this work, we investigate how the intrinsic particle nature of fermionic DM influences neutron star structure. Within a relativistic mean-field framework extended by a scalar (or Higgs like) portal coupling between DM and nucleons, we construct self-consistent equation of states for both Dirac and Majorana cases and solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to obtain stellar configurations. Owing to the difference in internal degrees of freedom, Dirac DM (four degrees of freedom) generally softens the equation of state more strongly than Majorana DM (two degrees of freedom), leading to smaller radii and lower maximum masses. We identify the parameter space consistent with current NICER and gravitational-wave constraints, highlighting the potential of compact-star observations to discriminate between Dirac and Majorana dark matter."}

A key concern arises if these stellar-mass binary black holes reside in gaseous environments such as active galactic nucleus accretion disks, where environmental effects imprint detectable modulations on the gravita- tional waveform. Using Bayesian inference on simulated signals containing both environmental and dipole deviation, we have assessed the extent to which the presence of environmental effects affects the detectability of dipole radiation. Our results demonstrate that even in the presence of strong environmental coupling, the dipole parameter can be recovered with high precision, and the evidence for dipole radiation remains distinguishable. Crucially, we find that the existence of environmental effects does not fundamentally impede the identification of dipole radiation, provided both effects are simultaneously modelled in the inference process. This study establishes that future tests of modified gravity with space-borne observatories can remain robust even for sources in astrophysical environments."}

As a result, any source fluctuation near the black hole creates multiple lagged images on an observer's screen. For optically thin stochastic emission, these light echoes give rise to correlations of brightness fluctuations across time-dependent images (movies). The correlation pattern disentangles source-specific characteristics from universal features dictated by general relativity. This picture has motivated a proposal to use the two-point image correlation function as a probe of extreme gravitational lensing in upcoming black-hole imaging campaigns. In this work, we test the feasibility of this method by computing the two-point correlation function of brightness fluctuations in a black-hole movie of state-of-the-art realism. The movie is generated by ray tracing a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation, which can then be blurred to any angular resolution. At an effective resolution expected to be achieved by next-generation terrestrial very-long-baseline interferometric arrays, the lensing signatures appear in neither time-averaged images nor light-curve autocorrelations. However, we demonstrate that they are clearly visible in the more fine-grained two-point image correlation function. Our positive findings motivate a more comprehensive investigation into the instrument specifications and inference techniques needed to resolve extreme lensing effects through correlations."}

Hence, an accurate measurement of jet power is critical for understanding black hole growth through accretion and also for quantifying the impact of kinetic feedback. However, the absence of instantaneous jet power measurements has precluded direct comparisons with the accretion luminosity, forcing kinetic feedback models to rely on ad hoc assumptions about how much jet power is released per accreted amount of mass. Here we report the detection of stellar wind-induced bending of the jets in the black hole X-ray binary Cygnus X-1, using 18 years of high-resolution radio imaging. By modeling jet-wind interactions, we determine the current kinetic instantaneous power of the jet to be log$_{10}(L_{\\rm jet}/{\\rm erg\\,s}^{-1}) = 37.3_{-0.2}^{+0.1}$, comparable to the accretion energy determined from its bolometric X-ray luminosity. This result critically places prevailing assumptions about the energetics of black hole powered jets in both galaxy formation simulations, and in scaling models of black hole accretion, on a firm empirical footing."}

Recently, identification of fast-moving stars in the core of $ω$ Cen provided the strongest evidence to date for the presence of such an IMBH. One of the key questions in the study of IMBHs is their accretion efficiency, which determines their radio and X-ray signatures. We investigate the accretion signature of the IMBH in $ω$ Cen with ultra-deep radio continuum observations of the central region of the cluster. Using approximately 170 hours of Australia Telescope Compact Array observations, we achieve a root mean square noise of 1.1 $μ$Jy at 7.25 GHz, making this the most sensitive radio image of the cluster to date. We detect no radio emission at any of the proposed centers of the cluster, imposing stringent constraints on the presence of an accreting IMBH in $ω$ Cen. Considering the fundamental plane of black hole activity, our findings indicate that the accretion efficiency around the black hole is exceptionally low (with a conservative 3-$σ$ upper limit of $ε\\lesssim 4\\times10^{-3}$)."}

By modeling proton injection, the study explores how the acceleration of protons in massive star clusters contributes to the gamma radiation detectable from Earth. The analysis focuses on two primary types of clusters: widespread, dispersed clusters and younger, compact massive clusters, both of which host shock waves generated by supernova remnants (SNR). Clusters located near the solar system, within a 3-kiloparsec radius,are identified. Analytical methods are used to calculate energy spectra and gamma-ray production rates. The findings suggest that young and compact MSC contribute to multi-TeV to PeV gamma-ray emission, with the dominant contribution arising from nearby populations."}

Since $M_0$ is not an observable quantity, this normalisation hinders the direct applicability of the relations. A common remedy assumes that $M_0$ coincides with the actual mass of the star $M_S$; however, this approximation is only adequate for very slow rotation (when the dimensionless spin parameter is $χ_S<0.1$). The more accurate alternative approach, based on the $I$-Love-$Q$-$δM$ set of relations, circumvents this limitation by enabling the inference of $M_0$. Here we review both approaches and provide numerical comparisons."}
