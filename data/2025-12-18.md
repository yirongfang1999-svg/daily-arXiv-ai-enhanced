Abstract: The ESA Gaia mission has revolutionized our understanding of the white dwarf population, delivering an unprecedented census of these nearby remnants and revealing previously unseen structures in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. However, while Gaia has expanded the scope of white dwarf astrophysics, it has also exposed new questions related to atmospheric composition, spectral evolution, crystallization, magnetism, and merger-driven pathways. Many of these open problems are encoded in the detailed morphology of the Gaia HR diagram, where precise spectroscopic characterization is essential for interpreting the underlying physical processes. Spectroscopic characterization, obtainable with current and future ESO facilities, can provide the effective temperatures and surface gravities that are required to derive accurate white dwarf masses, cooling ages, and luminosities. These fundamental parameters not only enable studies of spectral evolution, interior physics, and the origin of magnetic and high-mass white dwarfs, but also guarantee the construction of robust mass distributions and luminosity functions, essential for constraining the initial-to-final mass relation, probing the initial mass function, and reconstructing the star formation history of the local Galaxy, among other applications. Looking toward the 2040s, future multi-fiber spectrographs operating in survey mode on 10--15 meter class telescopes will be able to collect a complete spectroscopic sample of white dwarf, enabling the detailed characterization of their population. Achieving spectroscopic completeness for the nearby Galactic population and securing high signal-to-noise, moderate-to-high resolution spectra across the HR diagram with ESO instrumentation will be critical steps toward resolving these longstanding questions in white dwarf astrophysics.

Abstract: The millimeter/sub-millimeter (mm/sub-mm) sky remains a rich but under-explored frontier for transient and variable phenomena. A wide-field, high-sensitivity instrument with a large aperture and degree-scale field of view would open this regime, enabling both systematic survey monitoring and rapid-response follow-up. Key science opportunities include Galactic Plane monitoring and surveys to discover and characterize time-variable emission from young stellar objects, magnetically active and flaring stars, compact binaries, and explosive events, as well as prompt responses to multi-messenger alerts with large localization regions (e.g., gravitational-wave triggers). Multi-band capability, rapid slewing, and high sensitivity are essential to probe energetic processes such as jet launching, relativistic shocks and accretion flows in unprecedented detail. While long-term monitoring is well established at radio and optical/infrared wavelengths, mm/sub-mm observations uniquely bridge the spectral gap between these regimes, directly probing obscured environments that are inaccessible elsewhere. Large-scale monitoring programs will yield legacy datasets crucial for population studies through the 2040s and beyond.

Abstract: Deriving precise stellar ages is a challenging task. Consequently, age-dependent relations - such as the age-metallicity and age-velocity dispersion relations of the Milky Way, or the age-rotation-activity relation of low-mass stars - are subject to potentially large uncertainties, despite the well-defined trends observed at the population level. White dwarfs, the most common stellar remnants, follow a relatively simple and well-understood cooling process. When found in wide binary systems with main-sequence companions, they can therefore provide the much-needed precise age estimates. The total age of such systems depends not only on the white dwarf cooling time but also on the lifetime of the main-sequence progenitor. Estimating this lifetime requires knowledge of the progenitor mass, which is typically inferred by adopting an initial-to-final mass relation. However, the observational constraints on this relation are still poorly defined, introducing a source of uncertainty in white dwarf age determinations. To mitigate this issue, we focus on a large sample of massive white dwarfs (>~0.7 Msun), for which the main-sequence progenitor lifetime is negligible. These white dwarfs are intrinsically faint and therefore require specialized facilities for adequate follow-up observations. In this white paper, we outline the instrumentation requirements needed to observe the forthcoming population of massive white dwarfs in our Galaxy.

Abstract: Understanding the formation, evolution, and chemical diversity of exoplanets are now central areas of astrophysics research. White dwarfs provide a uniquely sensitive laboratory for studying the end stages of planetary-system evolution and for probing the bulk composition of both rocky and volatile-rich exoplanetary material. In the 2030s new facilities will transform our ability to carry out \textit{``industrial-scale''} astrophysics, leading to fundamental results and new challenges for the next decade. By combining the volume of data surveyed by the ESA {\em Gaia} mission and Vera C. Rubin Observatory with the next-generation of spectroscopic facilities, the European Southern Observatory (ESO) community will be in a position to obtain an unbiased census of evolved planetary systems, constrain the composition of thousands of disrupted planetesimals, and connect these signatures to Galactic populations and stellar birth environments. Thus, it is now the time for assessing those challenges and preparing for the future. This white paper outlines key science opportunities arising in the next decade and the technological requirements of future ESO facilities in enabling transformative discoveries in the 2040s. These future facilities will have to combine a number of features that are crucial for studying evolved planetary systems at white dwarfs, such as broad optical to near-infrared coverage, a high sensitivity at blue wavelengths, multi-resolution capability, massive multi-plexing, and time-domain reactivity.

Abstract: How a star forms is a fundamental question in astrophysics. In the earliest stages of protostellar evolution high extinction prevents a direct study of the accretion processes and their temporal evolution. Monitoring the variations of the accretion luminosity in a large protostar sample over decades is needed to reveal how protostars accrete -- in major bursts or in a quasi-steady fashion. We here argue that a large ground based sub-millimeter single-dish facility with a wide FoV is required to fulfill this task.

Abstract: This white paper highlights how stellar population gradients, chemical abundance patterns, stellar initial mass function (IMF) variations, and structural signatures in early-type galaxies (ETGs), measured at faint and large galactocentric radii, out to $\sim4R_e$, provide powerful diagnostics of their formation and evolutionary histories. These observables encode the combined effects of early dissipative star formation, subsequent accretion and mergers, and internal feedback processes. Achieving such measurements requires high-signal-to-noise, spatially resolved U-band--optical--near-IR spectroscopy at large radii, with enough spatial resolution to study the variation of these properties on $\sim$kpc scales. These capabilities can only be delivered by a 30\,m-class telescope. Disentangling these internal processes from environmental influences further demands observations of galaxies across clusters spanning a wide range of evolutionary stages and local environments. The nearby Virgo, Perseus, and Coma clusters, without any comparable nearby counterparts in the Southern Hemisphere, offer ideal laboratories for this work. Such observations will place stringent constraints on the formation mechanism of ETGs, connecting local cluster ETGs to their high-redshift progenitors. This white paper outlines several key science cases enabled by such a facility: (1) mapping stellar population gradients across environments; (2) tracing IMF variations as a function of evolutionary stage and environment; (3) reconstructing the three-dimensional structure of galaxies through deep integral-field spectroscopy and imaging; and (4) identifying and studying compact and relic systems as progenitors of present-day ETGs.

Abstract: Full sky coverage with 30-40 meter-class telescopes is essential to answer fundamental questions in Astrophysics, Cosmology, and Physics, such as the composition of the Universe and the formation of the first stars and supermassive black holes. An ELT/TMT-like telescope in the Northern Hemisphere is a fundamental and necessary facility to provide multiplexing of observing power, diversity of instrumentation, rapid response, and statistical power required to address the questions and the problems, current and future, unveiled by full sky observatories such as JWST, Euclid, or Roman space telescopes. The Northern ELT/TMT will expedite the study of unique, extreme, rare, transient, and/or high-energy events which will give the most information about fundamental Physics problems in the era of multi-messenger and time-domain Astronomy.

Abstract: The detection and characterization of protoplanets in protoplanetary disks around young stars is emerging as a transformative field that will redefine our understanding of how planetary systems form. While current facilities have revealed the diversity of mature exoplanets and the complex structures of disks, we still lack the crucial observational link between them: a statistically meaningful census of planets caught in the act of formation. This white paper argues that such a breakthrough requires access to the nearest and most informative star-forming regions, roughly half of which are poorly accessible or entirely unreachable from Cerro Armazones. Although the ELT alone will strongly impact our knowledge of planet formation, its location prevents Europe from fully exploiting the necessary parameter space. A 30-40 m telescope in the northern hemisphere is therefore essential for obtaining diffraction-limited imaging of protoplanets and disks across the entire sky, enabling robust demographics, exploiting synergies with ngVLA, Gaia, and other facilities covering the north, and ensuring that Europe remains at the forefront of the planet-formation revolution in the coming decades.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Dwarf galaxies dominate the galaxy population in the nearby Universe and occupy the regime where feedback, reionization, and environment exert their strongest influence on galaxy formation. Despite their importance, detailed spectroscopic constraints on the faintest dwarfs are currently limited to a handful of systems in the Local Volume, leaving the role of large-scale environment essentially unexplored at ultra-low stellar masses. A northern 30-40m class telescope equipped with a multiplexed optical integral-field spectrograph will enable a systematic, spatially resolved spectroscopic census of dwarf galaxies with $M_\star \sim 10^{5}-10^{7} M_\odot$ across a wide range of environments. A deep survey of the Coma Cluster, combined with targeted observations of dwarfs in clusters, groups, filaments, and low-density regions, will map star formation histories, chemical enrichment, and internal kinematics at unprecedented depth. This program will directly test models of dark-matter physics, early-Universe feedback, and environmental quenching in the lowest-mass galaxies, establishing dwarf galaxies as precision probes of both galaxy formation and fundamental physics.

Abstract: The Extragalactic Low Surface Brightness (LSB, $μ_V\gtrsim 27$ mag/arcsec$^2$) Universe represents a crucial, yet largely unseen, frontier in modern astrophysics. This faint realm holds the keys to completing our understanding of galaxy evolution, hierarchical assembly, and even the fundamental nature of dark matter. Our current theoretical models are inherently incomplete, largely mirroring the properties of the brightest, most easily observed objects. To overcome this critical bias and unlock the secrets of this realm, a transformative leap in observational capability is required. A 30 to 40m class telescope, leveraging unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution, especially with adaptive optics, is the essential tool to fundamentally probe these faint, low-density stellar regimes. This white paper details the transformative LSB science that such a facility, strategically positioned in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) to access crucial nearby structures and rich environments, can achieve.

Abstract: Small Solar system Objects (SSOs) preserve the physical, chemical, and dynamical signatures of the Sun's protoplanetary disk. Upcoming surveys will discover vast numbers of new objects, yet their scientific value will depend on follow-up observations requiring far greater sensitivity and resolution than those currently available. A 30-m class telescope like the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) will be transformative, but its Southern location will leave significant regions of the sky poorly covered or even non accessible. A Northern 30-40m telescope is therefore essential to achieve full-sky coverage and fully exploit the small body discoveries of the 2030-2050 era, in particular for targets of opportunity or unexpected discoveries, like those of interstellar objects and potentially hazardous asteroids, as well as for distant trans-Neptunian objects and space mission targets.

Abstract: Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are dense, compact stellar systems only a few parsecs across, located at galaxy centers. Their small sizes make them difficult to resolve spatially. NSCs often coexist with massive black holes, and both trace the dynamical state and evolution of their host galaxies. Dense stellar environments such as NSCs are also ideal sites for forming intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). To date, spatially resolved NSC properties, crucial for reconstructing dynamical and star-formation histories, have only been obtained for galaxies within 5 Mpc, using the highest-resolution instruments on the current class of very large telescopes. This severely limits spectroscopic studies, and a systematic, unbiased survey has never been accomplished. Because the vast majority of known NSCs are located in the Northern Hemisphere, only a 30-m-class telescope in the North can provide the statistical power needed to study their physical properties and measure the mass of coexisting central black holes. We propose leveraging the capabilities of a 30-m-class Northern telescope to obtain the first comprehensive, spatially resolved survey of NSCs, finally allowing us to unveil their formation pathways and their yet unknown connection with central massive black holes.

Abstract: Massive stars are at the core of our observations of the Universe up to the reionization epoch, both through their intense ionizing fluxes and through the energetic end products that release fresh elements into the interstellar medium. Our interpretation of very high redshift galaxies and transient phenomena depends on knowledge derived from massive star populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, with characteristics that only remotely resemble the conditions in the early Universe. However, the models supporting these interpretations have been tested in a narrow range of environments and carry significant uncertainties when extrapolated. Advancing in our understanding of the Universe beyond the Local Volume therefore requires extending massive star studies to conditions representative of the early Universe. The next generation of telescopes has the potential to accomplish this goal.

Abstract: A 30 m class optical/near-IR telescope in the Northern Hemisphere, equipped for diffraction-limited imaging and high-resolution, multi-object spectroscopy of faint stars, would enable a transformational investigation of the formation and evolution of M31 and its satellite system - on par with what Gaia, the HST, and other major photometric and spectroscopic facilities have achieved for the Milky Way (MW) and its satellites. The unprecedented detail obtained for our home system has reshaped our understanding of the assembly of the MW disk, halo, and bulge, and that of its satellites, which now serve as a benchmark for galaxy formation and evolution models. Extending this level of insight to the M31 system - that of the nearest massive spiral and the only one for which such a comprehensive, resolved stellar population study is feasible - will allow us to address a fundamental question: how representative is the MW and its satellite system within the broader context of galaxy evolution?

Abstract: White dwarf binaries are fundamental astrophysical probes. They represent ideal laboratories to test the models of binary evolution, which also apply to the sources of gravitational waves, whose detection led to the award of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Moreover, their final fate is intimately linked to Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), i.e. the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf following the interaction with a companion star, which have become the fundamental yardsticks on cosmological distance scales and led to the discovery of dark energy and the award of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. Finally, white dwarf binaries play a crucial role in influencing star formation and chemical evolution of the Galaxy by injecting energy into, and enriching, the interstellar medium with material ejected during nova eruptions and SN Ia explosions. In the next decade, the advent of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) at the Vera Rubin Observatory will lead to the discovery of hundreds of thousands of white dwarf binaries. Nonetheless, the intrinsic faintness of the majority of these systems will prevent their spectroscopic characterisation with the instruments available in the 2030s. Hence ESO's Expanding Horizons call is timely for planning a future transformative facility, capable of delivering phase-resolved spectroscopic observations of faint white dwarf binaries, which are key to advancing our understanding of stellar and Galactic evolution and cosmology.

Abstract: By the 2040s--50s, facilities such as \emph{Gaia}, WEAVE, 4MOST, Rubin, \emph{Euclid}, \emph{Roman}, and the ESO ELT will have transformed our global view of the Milky Way. Yet key questions will remain incompletely resolved: a detailed reconstruction of the Galaxy's assembly from its earliest building blocks, and robust tests of dark matter granularity using the fine structure of the stellar halo and outer disk -- particularly in the Galactic anticenter. Addressing these questions requires high-resolution spectroscopy of faint main-sequence stars (typically 1--2 mag below the turnoff) and turnoff stars ($r \sim 21$--23) in low-surface-brightness structures: halo streams and shells, ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, the warped and flared outer disk, and anticenter substructures. We argue that addressing this science case requires a 30\,m-class telescope in the northern hemisphere, equipped with wide-field, highly multiplexed, high-resolution spectroscopic capabilities. Such a facility would enable (i) a Northern Halo Deep Survey of $\sim 10^{5}$--$10^{6}$ faint main-sequence and turnoff stars out to $\sim 150$--200\,kpc, (ii) chemodynamical mapping of dozens of streams to measure perturbations from dark matter subhalos, and (iii) tomographic studies of the anticenter and outer disk to disentangle perturbed disk material from accreted debris. A northern 30\,m telescope would provide the essential complement to ESO's southern ELT, enabling genuinely all-sky Milky Way archaeology and delivering stringent constraints on the small-scale structure of dark matter.

Abstract: Dynamical binary interactions such as common envelope (CE) evolution or stellar mergers are a critical phase in the formation of a wide variety of binary phenomena, ranging from blue stragglers to type I supernovae (of all flavours, a, b and c), $γ$-ray bursts to bipolar planetary nebulae, Thorne-Zytkow objects to X-ray binaries. In 2040s, the urgency of resolving long-standing questions regarding the physics behind the dynamical interaction stages and the absolute and relative frequencies of binary evolutionary pathways will only increase owing to rapidly expanding population statistics of gravitational wave events. Here, we argue that multi-wavelength observations (spectroscopy and photometry), linear spectropolarimetry, and interferometry of a large number of Luminous Red Novae, a particular class of transients associated with dynamical binary interactions, will provide unprecedented details about the underlying interaction physics. A breakthrough will be achieved by a tenfold or larger increase in identifications of transient-type events from interacting binaries and their follow-up with instrumentation that provides at least 10 times better angular resolution, 100 times better spectral resolution, and $\sim$100 times higher sensitivity than 2030s facilities.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Star-forming dwarf galaxies in the local Universe, especially extremely metal-poor ones, can be considered analogous to early galaxies of the Epoch of Reionization (z >= 6). Currently available telescopes cannot adequately detect and measure heavy element recombination lines and certain faint collisionally excited lines, which are essential for exploring the effects and biases that potential inhomogeneities in electron temperature and density of the ionized gas may have on determining the chemical composition of these galaxies. On the other hand, the origin of very high-ionization lines (e.g. He II, [Ne V], C IV]) measured in the spectra of an important fraction of these objects remains unknown and a challenge to current stellar models, suggesting the presence of Population III-like stars and/or the existence of non-conventional ionizing sources. Obtaining very deep spectra for a selected sample of local star-forming dwarf galaxies would provide unprecedented constraints on their nature, ionization and true chemical abundances, and could change the metallicity scale we assume to understand the chemical evolution of galaxies over cosmic time.

Abstract: Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs) are a class of extragalactic transient of uncertain origin. Several hypotheses have been put forward which could feasibly be consistent with the sample number of events discovered thus far, including tidal disruption events around intermediate mass black holes, failed supernovae and mergers of stars with black holes. Whatever their origin, it is clear that better understanding LFBOTs will provide unique insight into the black hole formation/growth, central engine physics and transient-host galaxy interactions - themes which are expected to drive research in transient astronomy over the coming decades. The vast majority of LFBOTs are missed by current photometric surveys, or not efficiently selected for detailed follow-up. This white paper outlines the observing capabilities required on a 2040 timescale to maximise the discovery potential from these enigmatic events.

Abstract: The Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) will transform our knowledge of the outer planets and their satellite systems; however the visibility of unique targets of opportunity with high scientific value will be reduced for northern objects. Uranus' declination favors observations from the Northern Hemisphere until 2055, and Neptune will be favored from the Northern Hemisphere from 2027 for the next 90 years. Jupiter and Saturn experience cycles of better observability from either hemisphere on cycles of 10 and 30 years. These planets and their satellite systems often offer unique opportunities for discovery through time-critical observations. We argue that a 30-m class size telescope in the Northern Hemisphere with complementary scientific instrumentation to that on the ELT will secure the possibility of observing high-impact unpredictable phenomena in these systems.

Abstract: This document discusses the three main lines expected to dominate massive-star research in the 2040s, namely: (1) The role of metallicity in stellar evolution, especially in determining the end products such as gravitational-wave progenitors. (2) The initial mass function from the most massive stars to substellar objects. (3) The role of the environment in the different modes of star formation from compact star clusters to born-this-way associations and from massive clusters to small stellar groups. More specifically, we present the contributions to such science that would be enabled by a 30~m type telescope in the northern hemisphere studying spiral galaxies. Those can be grouped in three: our own Galaxy, the Milky Way; the other two spiral galaxies in the Local Group, M31 and M33; and other galaxies within 25 Mpc, such as M101, M51, and NGC~6946. This work is based on the fact that, as of today, no construction of a 30~m telescope has yet started in the northern hemisphere, so even in the best case scenario of such a hypothetical telescope, its full operation would not start until the late 2030s or early 2040s. It makes no assumptions about its location but supposes an instrumentation development similar to that of ELT.

Abstract: Debris discs reveal the architectures and dynamical histories of planetary systems. Sub-millimetre observations trace large dust grains within debris discs, revealing their bulk properties. Debris discs have so far only been detected around ~20% of stars, representing the bright end of the population. A new facility is required to reach fainter discs, overcoming the confusion limit, with multiwavelength capabilities for characterisation, sensitivity to large-scale emission for nearby targets and a large field of view for surveying distant populations. All of this is made possible with the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimetre Telescope (AtLAST).

Abstract: Underground laboratories provide the ultra-low background and low-vibration environments essential for rare-event searches, gravitational-wave detection, and quantum-sensing technologies. We report a comprehensive environmental characterisation of the Bedretto tunnel in Ticino, Switzerland, a site offering horizontal access, excellent infrastructure, and the potential to be be Europe's second-deepest and quietest underground laboratory. At the prospective physics site, located beneath an overburden exceeding 1400 m, we measure the cosmic-muon, gamma-ray, and neutron fluxes, as well as the radon concentration, magnetic-field spectrum, and seismic backgrounds. The muon flux is suppressed by six orders of magnitude relative to the surface, consistent with an effective depth of about 4000 metre water equivalent, gamma-ray and neutron measurements reflect the local geology and guide shielding requirements for future particle and nuclear physics experiments. Magnetic and seismic noise levels are found to be exceptionally low, meeting or exceeding the criteria for next-generation atom-interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. These results establish the site as a highly competitive, accessible deep-underground location for fundamental-physics experiments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Space-based photometry has substantially increased the number of pulsating stars found in binary systems by more than four orders of magnitude. Combined with high-resolution spectroscopy, high-precision photometry offers model-independent constraints on stellar parameters and internal processes. The advent of space-based photometric surveys has given us access to populations of tidally perturbed pulsators, which offer a unique and demanding set of constraints on tidal physics and stellar interiors. However, we lack the ability to undertake multi-epoch, high-resolution spectroscopy at large scale. The ability to obtain phase-resolved, high-resolution spectra would allow us to place precise, model-independent constraints on the stellar properties of pulsators in binary systems that will truly test our close binary asteroseismic modelling techniques, leading to much-needed constraints on fundamental stellar and binary physics. The need to properly cover the large parameter-space of binary stars demands a large-scale, population-level analysis in order to understand the complex landscape of binary stellar evolution. To enable this population-level analysis, we need a dedicated multi-fibre spectrograph (30--200 fibres) with high spectral resolution ($R\geq 50000$), high signal-to-noise ratio ($\mathrm{S/N\geq 300}$), and a limiting magnitude of approximately 15. Such a spectrograph would be capable of efficiently resolving the pulsation variability on the order of minutes and orbit motion on the order of days to years for many targets.

Abstract: Modern wide-field surveys require robust spatial masks to excise bright-star halos, bleed trails, poor-quality regions, and user-defined geometry at scale. We present Skykatana, an open source pipeline that builds and combines boolean HEALPix/HEALSparse maps into science-ready masks and engineered for low-memory operation. Skykatana can efficiently construct, visualize multi-order coverage maps and generate random points in high-resolution masks over half of the celestial sphere with very limited resources and leveraging the hierarchical partition of data the HATS/LSDB framework. We demonstrate two end-to-end applications: (1) a Subaru HSC-WISE composite mask; and (2) Rubin star masks generated on demand in the Rubin Science Platform by querying HATS/LSDB Gaia data and assigning radii from empirical fits to Rubin DP1 data. We release full bright-star masks for various regions of the Rubin footprint and describe performance and scaling. The code, documentation, and examples are publicly available at https://github.com/samotracio/skykatana, and the LSST masks can be obtained from https://osf.io/r5vw6

Abstract: Current experiments seeking first-ever observation of Ultra-High Energy Neutrinos (UHEN) typically utilize radio frequency (RF) receiver antennas deployed in cold, radio-transparent polar ice, to measure the coherent RF signals resulting from neutrino interactions with ice molecules. Accurate calibration of the receiver response, sampling the full range of possible neutrino geometries, is necessary to estimate the energy and incoming direction of the incident neutrino. Herein, we detail the design and performance of a custom radio-frequency calibration transmitter, consisting of a battery-powered, kiloVolt-scale signal generator (`IDL' pulser) driving an antenna (South Pole UNiversity of Kansas antenna, or `SPUNK') capable of operating at pressures of 200 atmospheres. Performance was validated by lowering the transmitter into a borehole at the South Pole to a depth of 1740 m, yielding high Signal-to-Noise ratio signals at a distance of 5 km from the source.

Abstract: The thermal emission at sub-millimeter wavelengths carries unique information in many astronomical applications ranging from disks and planet formation around young stars, to galaxy evolution studies at cosmological distances. Advancing on the mapping speed to detect this faint emission in ground-based astronomy has been a technical challenge for decades. The APEX Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (AMKID) camera was designed to accomplish this task. The instrument is a wide field-of-view camera based on kinetic inductance detectors. It is installed on the 12~meter APEX telescope in Chile at 5.100~meters above see level. The instrument operates dual color, covering simultaneously the 350~GHz and 850~GHz atmospheric windows. It has a large field-of-view of 15.3'x15.3', and an unprecedented number of pixels: 13.952~detectors in the high frequency band and 3.520~detectors in the low frequency band. Here we present a complete description of the instrument design and construction together with results of the successful low frequency array (LFA) commissioning campaign executed during the last year. The LFA performance is in good agreement with design parameters, with detector sensitivity of 2.2~mK$\sqrt{s}$ and diffraction limited beam sizes of 17.0''. On-sky measurements demonstrate a sensitivity of 70-90~mJy$\sqrt{s}$ per detector when operating under good atmospheric conditions (PWV below 1.0mm). With this performance the LFA regularly achieve a mapping sensitivity of 25~mJy when mapping a square degree in an hour.
  AMKID on APEX with its dual color observing capabilities, high sensitivity, large field-of-view and high angular resolution holds the promise to open a new range of science with the APEX telescope.

Abstract: The study explored the usage of astronomical observations for the identification and tracking of artificial satellites. Spacecraft streaks on astronomical images are a growing issue for the astronomical community. The increasing number of satellites in the future will only worsen the situation for ground-based optical and radio observations of cosmic objects. In addition, the spacecraft passages often lead to the discarding of the obtained data. In this analysis, we propose an estimation of the usefulness of dedicated astronomical observation for spacecraft monitoring, identification, and deduction of orbital parameters. We use astronomical data from the Astronomical Observatory Meshtitsa (Bulgaria) and the https://www.tycho-tracker.com/ software for the streak analysis. The results are compared with well-known satellite databases, such as https://celestrak.org/. The findings are discussed in the framework of space weather research.

Abstract: The polarization of light is a critically under-utilized, rich source of information in astronomy. For stars in particular, surface magnetism polarization that can be detected and measured with spectro-polarimetry. Many questions about these surface fields remain unanswered due to a lack of dedicated instruments capable of probing weak and strong surface magnetic fields for the entire mass range of stars, from M-dwarfs (and even substellar objects) to massive O-type stars at different evolutionary stages and metallicities. These questions range from the origin of these fields to their true incidence rate throughout the stellar population and the dependence on metallicity. Magnetic fields, although currently often excluded from stellar evolution models, play an important role in stellar evolution. Connecting the surface fields to internal fields through asteroseismology will instigate a new era of understanding stellar evolution and the transport of angular momentum and chemical elements throughout stellar interiors, also impacting our understanding of star-planet interactions and stellar remnants. Polarimetry is also an under-utilized tool to observationally constrain the mode identification of nonradial oscillations, which lies at the basis of accurate asteroseismic parameter estimation at percentage-level for stellar radii, masses, ages, internal rotation, and magnetic field strengths. Combining strong constraints on mode identification and surface magnetic properties through the acquisition of time-resolved, high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise (S/N) spectro-polarimetry and spectroscopy promises to bring leaps forward in our understanding of stellar structure, particularly when combined with long-term space photometric data from past, current, and future missions.

Abstract: The JWST MIRI detector exhibits a flux deficit persistence, but its timescales and impacts remain largely uncharacterized, particularly at the longest imaging wavelengths. In this study, we analyze full-field MIRI imager observations at 21 $μ$m (F2100W) to quantify detector persistence following a saturation event by a bright (K = 5.65 mag) nearby (8.12 $\pm$ 0.04 pc) mid M-dwarf star, IRAS 21500+5903. Unlike typical persistence that appears as excess flux, this effect presents as a flux deficit in pixels previously illuminated by the saturating or near saturating source. We measure persistence at two post-saturation epochs: shortly after saturation (11.6 minutes) and an hour later (1.39 hours). Immediately after the saturation event, we detect a persistence level of $1.69 \pm 0.10$%. By fitting a Bayesian exponential decay model to the two epochs, we estimate that persistence decreases to one-tenth of its initial value after $5.16^{+1.49}_{-0.94}$ hours. We examine the implications of persistence for MIRI high-contrast imaging using the imager (not coronagraphy). Specifically, we discuss how MIRI detector persistence can produce false-positive exoplanet signals in direct imaging surveys, as well as degrade PSF subtraction, particularly at small inner working angles. We also outline mitigation strategies to avoid these impacts in future observations.

Abstract: Time-domain astronomy is entering an era of unprecedented discovery driven by wide-field, high-cadence surveys such as LSST, Roman, Euclid, SKA, and PLATO. While some of these facilities will generate enormous photometric alert streams, the physical interpretation of variability and transients often requires spectroscopy, which encodes changes in ionisation state, kinematics, and accretion that are inaccessible to photometry alone. A critical gap is therefore emerging: next-generation surveys may produce up to $\sim10^9$ alerts per year, whereas global spectroscopic follow-up is limited to only $\sim10^4$--$10^5$ transient spectra annually. We present the concept of spectroscopic alerts: real-time notifications triggered by significant spectral evolution, enabling spectroscopy to act as a discovery channel rather than solely as follow-up. We outline the key science cases enabled by this capability and describe the instrumental and operational requirements of a wide-field, highly multiplexed spectroscopic facility capable of delivering real-time spectral discovery for 2040s time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy.

Abstract: High-dimensional astronomical data cubes provide a wealth of spectral and structural information that can be used to study astrophysical and chemical processes. The complexity and sheer size of these datasets pose significant challenges in their efficient analysis, visualization, and interpretation. In specific astronomical use cases, a number of dimensionality reduction techniques, including traditional linear (e.g. principal component analysis) and modern nonlinear methods (e.g. convolutional autoencoders) have been used to tackle this high-dimensional problem. In this study, we assess the strengths, weaknesses, and nuances of various methods in their ability to capture and preserve astronomically-relevant features at lower dimensions. We provide recommendations to guide users in identifying and incorporating these treatments to their data, and provide insights into the computational scalability of these methods for observatory level data processing. This benchmark study uses publicly available archival ALMA data from a diverse sampling of source morphologies and observing setups to assess the performance and trade-offs between computational cost, image reconstruction accuracy, and scalability. Finally, we discuss the generalizability of these techniques in regard to data segmentation and labeling algorithms and how they can be exploited for advanced data product generation and streamlined archival analysis as we prepare to enter the era of the ALMA Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade.

Abstract: Over the last 15 years, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revolutionized astrophysics by providing unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in observing the cold universe, including the formation of stars, planets, and galaxies. With groundbreaking discoveries ranging from the first detailed images of protoplanetary disks to the kinematics of galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization, ALMA has showcased the vast discovery potential of the (sub-)mm wavelength regime. However, in another 15 years from now--in the 2040s--the science landscape will have changed dramatically as new major observational facilities will have started their operations or have come towards advanced maturity in their scientific outcome (e.g., JWST, Rubin Observatory, ELT, Euclid, Gaia, Plato, Ariel, Roman Space Telescope, SPHEREx, LiteBIRD, LISA, SKA and others). At the same time, ALMA's current Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade will have been in place for ~10 years, and ALMA itself will have been operational for 30 years. To fully exploit this era, the community needs a next-generation facility operating at (sub-)mm wavelengths with capabilities far beyond those possible within ALMA's current infrastructure.
  To this end, ALMA2040 is a community-driven initiative to define the key scientific questions of the 2040s and translate them into a technical vision for a next-generation transformational (sub-)millimeter facility. Our goal with this document is to summarize the current status of the effort, synthesize outcomes from the 2025 workshops, outline next steps toward a reference design concept, and invite broad participation from the global mm/sub-mm community to help shape this future facility.
  In the following we provide details on the process and scope. We invite everyone who wishes to join the effort and/or contribute to the dedicated White Papers planned for 2026.

Abstract: This work aims to choose potential astronomical sites that can be candidates for a new astronomical optical observatory in Ethiopia, in addition to the Entoto Observatory and Lalibela sites. For our primary investigation, the six basic criteria, namely the altitude of the mountains, artificial light pollution, cloud coverage, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction, are taken into account. Consequently, using the multi-criteria statistical analysis (MCSA) techniques, 21 high-potential places are selected and presented for further investigation out of 367 mountains. Those selected mountains are mapped and presented to study the future of the astronomical seeing effect. This study may contribute to the protection of those potential astronomical sites and their dark skies and the development of astrotourism for the sustainable development of modern astronomy in Ethiopia and in the East African region.

Abstract: We compute the achromatic gravitational imprint that Kerr spacetime leaves on linear polarization at the photon ring. Recasting parallel transport in a null Frenet--Serret frame yields a single scalar evolution law for the electric-vector position angle. On the observer's screen, the Kerr-minus-Schwarzschild pattern on the direct critical curve is nonzero, strictly odd under spin reversal after a half-turn azimuth relabelling, and tightly confined to a thin annulus. Using backward-shot, Carter-separated geodesics with midpoint RK2 transport, we achieve second-order convergence and degree-scale amplitudes that grow monotonically with spin and inclination (RMS $\simeq 0.5$--$2^\circ$ for $a/M\gtrsim 0.8$, $i\gtrsim 60^\circ$). Three independent constructions -- Frenet--Serret line integral, explicit Levi--Civita transport of the polarization vector, and the phase of the Walker--Penrose constant -- agree ray by ray. We then define a parity-odd ring estimator that is intrinsically achromatic after standard wavelength-squared regression, symmetry-protected against common even-parity systematics, and compressed into low azimuthal modes. This yields a minimal two-parameter template (spin and inclination) for mm/sub-mm polarimetry of horizon-scale rings in sources such as M87$^\ast$ and Sgr~A$^\ast$. The pipeline enables either a detection of the strong-field parallel-transport phase induced by frame dragging or informative upper limits.

Abstract: The stability of geodesic orbits around a regular hairy black hole, in the gravitational decoupling setup, is investigated by employing Lyapunov exponents, which quantify the divergence rate of nearby trajectories in dynamical systems. Both timelike and null geodesics are addressed, probing the effect of the hair parameter on orbital stability. Deviations from the Schwarzschild solution have a significant influence on orbit stability, potentially providing observational signatures. Quasinormal modes of regular hairy black holes are calculated, and their thermodynamic properties are discussed. Both the Rényi and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropies are reported, deepening our understanding of gravitational dynamics in the strong-field regime, contributing to ongoing approaches to modified gravity.

Abstract: We review a novel scenario for the emergence of spin-polarisation entangled squeezed graviton states from superradiant axionic clouds in the neighborhood of astrophysical rotating black holes (BHs). The entangled squeezed graviton states are produced by both, conventional General-Relativity (GR) type axion-gravity interactions, and gravitational Chern-Simons (gCS) anomalous terms coupled to axions, which are non-trivial in the presence of rotating BHs. The two kinds of terms have different-symmetry contributions to the entangled squeezed states. The squeezing parameter is estimated in a weak-quantum-gravity framework. Some phenomenology with respect to current and future interferometric detection devices is discussed. Importantly, current data from LIGO/Virgo Experiments can impose upper-bound constraints on the value of the squeezing parameter and, thus, on the lifetime of the axionic clouds. In addition to the above rather direct-detection possibility of squeezed gravitons, there is also the possibility of indirect detection of quantum gravitons in Cosmology, given that chiral quantum gravitational-wave (GW) perturbations in the primordial Universe may imply condensation of gCS terms. This, in turn, leads to inflation of running vacuum type, with in principle observable patterns in the profile of the GW produced during the post-inflationary early radiation era, as well as the potential of alleviating cosmic tensions in the current era.

Abstract: This thesis investigates late-time cosmic acceleration using modified gravity theories with a focus on $f(Q)$ gravity, as an alternative to the $Λ$CDM model. The standard cosmological model attributes the acceleration to a cosmological constant, but it faces issues like the unexplained nature of dark matter and dark energy and discrepancies with certain observations. Modified gravity including $f(Q)$ gravity, offers a potential solution by incorporating dynamic dark energy or changes to gravitational interactions, avoiding the need for a constant cosmological term. Also, thesis evaluates the viability of $f(Q)$ gravity by analyzing observational data from Type Ia Supernovae, Hubble parameter measurements and other cosmological datasets. Using statistical tools like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, this work constrains the parameters of $f(Q)$ gravity and compares it to the $Λ$CDM model.....

Abstract: A small fraction of gravitational-wave (GW) signals from binary black holes (BBHs) will be gravitationally lensed by intervening galaxies and galaxy clusters. Strong lensing will produce multiple identical copies of the GW signal arriving at different times. Jana et al.~\cite{Jana_2023} recently proposed a method to constrain cosmological parameters using strongly lensed GW events detected by next-generation (XG) detectors. The idea is that the number of strongly lensed GW events and the distribution of their lensing time delays encode imprints of the cosmological parameters. From the observed number of lensed GW events (tens of thousands) and their time delay distribution, this method can provide a new probe of cosmology, obtaining information at intermediate redshifts. In this work, we explore the possibility of doing lensing cosmography using upcoming observations of the upgraded LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network. This requires incorporating the detector network selection effects in the analysis, which was neglected earlier. We expect dozens of lensed GW events to be detected by upgraded LVK detectors, potentially enabling modest constraints on cosmological parameters. Even with relatively modest numbers of lensed detections, we demonstrate the potential of lensing cosmography. For XG detectors, our revised forecasts are consistent with with the earlier forecasts that neglected the selection effects.

Abstract: A pulsar, i.e., a spinning neutron star, with a deformation could emit gravitational waves continuously. Such continuous waves, which have not been detected yet, will be very useful to study gravitational physics and to probe the extreme physics of neutron stars. While typically such waves from a pulsar are estimated considering an overall stellar ellipticity, there can be multiple irregularities or mountains in the stellar crust that the gravity of the star cannot smooth. In this paper, we consider this realistic situation and compute the strain, power, torque and the pulsar spin-down rate due to multiple mountains supported by the stellar crust. Here, we consider astronomically motivated mountain distributions and use the Brans-Dicke theory of gravity which has three polarization states: two tensors dominated by the time-varying quadrupole moment and one scalar dominated by the time-varying dipole moment. We also give the limiting results for general relativity.

Abstract: Noncommutative gravity, based on a twist-deformation of the differential geometry of spacetime and a first-order formulation of the dynamics, requires additional gravitational degrees of freedom as well as an enlargement of the gauge group of Lorentz transformations of the tetrad frame. As such, it offers a theoretical playground to build fundamentally motivated extension to general relativity. The dynamical degrees of freedom include a ${\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ gauge connection and two independent tetrads. The theory allows for interaction terms between the two tetrads, whose structure displays some similarities with ghost-free bigravity. The extra gravitational degrees of freedom survive in the commutative limit. We show the effective action obtained in this limit, discuss its symmetries, and compare it with other bigravity theories. The dynamics of homogeneous and isotropic cosmological solutions split into two branches. One is characterized by a constant and purely spatial curvature two-form. The other displays a richer gauge freedom, and the Hamiltonian analysis of the dynamics reveals three extra first-class constraints in addition to the generator of time reparametrizations.

Abstract: We investigate quartically self-interacting massive boson stars by constructing equilibrium sequences and performing dynamical evolutions. The mass curve $M(|φ_c|)$ along these sequences develops multiple extrema, yet stability changes only at the first maximum; configurations beyond it become highly compact and collapse under numerically induced perturbations, with near-critical models displaying a short-lived double-dive behaviour. Head-on collisions of equal-mass stars yield three distinct outcomes - boson star remnants, black hole formation at contact, and collapse of each star to a black hole prior to contact. The associated gravitational-wave energies reflect the competition between increasing compactness and decreasing tidal deformability, and at large self-interaction strengths the collapse-before-contact branch exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic structure. The simulations reported here constitute a substantial catalogue of initial conditions and waveforms, providing a natural basis for neural-network techniques aimed at improving boson star initial data and constructing surrogate models capable of rapidly predicting gravitational-wave signals across an extended parameter space.

Abstract: We incorporate non-local gravitational self-energy, motivated by string-inspired T-duality, into the Schrödinger-Newton equation. In this framework spacetime has an intrinsic non-locality, rendering the standard linear superposition principle only an approximation valid in the absence of gravitational effects. We then invert the logic by assuming the validity of linear superposition and demonstrate that such superpositions inevitably become unstable once gravity is included. The resulting wave-function collapse arises from a fundamental tension between the equivalence principle and the quantum superposition principle in a semiclassical spacetime background. We further show that wave functions computed in inertial and freely falling frames differ by a gravitationally induced phase shift containing linear and cubic time contributions along with a constant global term. These corrections produce a global phase change and lead to a spontaneous, model-independent collapse time inversely proportional to the mass of the system.

Abstract: We investigate the thermal Casimir effect for a massless scalar field in the curved spacetime of a neutron star within the Thermo Field Dynamics (TFD) formalism. Starting from the renormalized energy-momentum tensor, we generalize the Stefan-Boltzmann law to include gravitational redshift and curvature corrections governed by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) metric. Finite temperature and spatial compactification are introduced simultaneously, allowing a unified and consistent treatment of both vacuum and thermal contributions inside and outside the star. Analytical expressions are derived for the high- and low-temperature limits, showing explicitly how curvature and redshift modify the characteristic $T^4$ dependence of thermal radiation. The results reveal that strong gravity significantly alters the local energy density and pressure, demonstrating the nontrivial interplay between quantum vacuum fluctuations and compact astrophysical geometries. A polytropic model is considered to perform numerical analyses, highlighting the influence of the spacetime background on vacuum fluctuations.

Abstract: We carry out the deepest and broadest search for continuous gravitational-wave signals with frequencies between 20-1500 Hz, from three neutron stars at the center of the supernova remnants Cassiopeia A, Vela Jr., and G347.3-0.5. This search was made possible by the computing power shared by thousands of Einstein@Home volunteers. After the initial Einstein@Home search, we perform a multi-stage follow-up of the most promising $\approx$ 45 million signal candidates. In the last stages, we use independent data to further investigate the remaining candidates from the previous stages. We set the most stringent constraints to date on the gravitational-wave amplitude, equatorial ellipticity, r-mode saturation amplitude, and -- for the first time -- the neutron-star crustal anisotropy. For spin periods lower than 2 ms we constrain the ellipticity to be smaller than $4\times 10^{-7}$ for all targets. We exclude the crustal anisotropy to be smaller than $5\times 10^{-3}$ for spin periods between 1.3-100 ms. Only one candidate -- from the low frequency G347.3 search -- survives all follow-ups. We illustrate properties of this candidate. Investigations on new data will aid in clarifying its nature. Such ``new" data exists and would be optimal for this purpose, but they are not publicly accessible at the time of writing.

Abstract: The optical fiber is a revolutionary technology of the past century. It enables us to manipulate single modes in nonlinear interactions with precision at the quantum level without involved setups. This setting is useful in the field of analogue gravity (AG), where gravitational phenomena are investigated in accessible analogue lab setups. These lecture notes provide an account of this AG framework and applications. Although light in nonlinear dielectrics is discussed in textbooks, the involved modelling often includes many assumptions that are directed at optical communications, some of which are rarely detailed. Here, we provide a self-contained and sufficiently detailed description of the propagation of light in fibers, with a minimal set of assumptions, which is relevant in the context of AG. Starting with the structure of a step-index fiber, we derive linear-optics propagating modes and show that the transverse electric field of the fundamental mode is well approximated as linearly polarized and of a Gaussian profile. We then incorporate a cubic nonlinearity and derive a general wave envelope propagation equation. With further simplifying assumptions, we arrive at the famous nonlinear Schrödinger equation, which governs fundamental effects in nonlinear fibers, such as solitons. As a first application in AG, we show how intense light in the medium creates an effective background spacetime for probe light akin to the propagation of a scalar field in a black hole spacetime. We introduce optical horizons and particle production in this effective spacetime, giving rise to the optical Hawking effect. Furthermore, we discuss two related light emission mechanisms. Finally, we present a second optical analogue model for the oscillations of black holes, the quasinormal modes, which are important in the program of black hole spectroscopy.

Abstract: There is currently no rigorous definition of gravitational wave strain at second order in cosmological perturbation theory. The usual association of gravitational waves with transverse and traceless fluctuations of the metric on spatial hypersurfaces becomes ambiguous at second order, as it inherently depends on the spacetime slicing. While this poses no practical issues in linearized gravity, it presents a fundamental problem for secondary gravitational waves, especially notorious for gravitational waves induced by primordial fluctuations. We compute, for the first time, the physical effects of gravitational waves at second order, as measured by geodesic observers that emit and receive electromagnetic signals, thereby settling the debate on gauge ambiguities. We find that the measured gravitational wave strain coincides with the transverse-traceless components in the Newton gauge.

Abstract: The formation of a compact accretion disk following a tidal disruption event (TDE) requires that the shocked stellar debris cool efficiently as it settles toward the black hole. While recent simulations suggest that stream dissipation occurs rapidly, how the weakly bound debris subsequently loses its thermal energy to assemble a compact disk near the circularization radius remains uncertain. We investigate this cooling process using axisymmetric radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of quasi-hydrostatic 'TDE envelopes', initialized with the total mass, angular momentum, and binding energy expected from a complete stellar disruption. The envelopes, supported by radiation pressure on large scales and rotation near the circularization radius, evolve through a combination of radiative diffusion, turbulent mixing, and polar outflows. In our fiducial model, a quasi-steady state is achieved in which a polar outflow radiates and expels matter at several times the Eddington luminosity. This enables the envelope to cool and contract, forming a dense, rotationally supported ring near the circularization radius, but on a timescale roughly ten times shorter than the naive photon-diffusion timescale. Comparative models without radiation transport confirm that cooling, not purely adiabatic evolution, is essential to driving this rapid inflow. Nevertheless, across a range of envelope masses, the effective envelope cooling time scales only weakly with its optical depth, implying that advective and wind-driven energy transport dominate over diffusion. Our results demonstrate the cooling-induced contraction, even absent viscosity and associated black hole accretion, can produce luminosities and large photosphere radii consistent with early UV/optical TDE emission. However, more quantitative light-curve predictions must incorporate self-consistent formation and feeding of the envelope by fall-back accretion.

Abstract: The recent 230 GHz observations by the Event Horizon Telescope have resolved the innermost structure of the M87 galaxy, revealing a ring-like feature consistent with thermal synchrotron emission from a magnetized torus surrounding a rotating supermassive black hole. Moreover, Global Millimeter VLBI Array observations at 86 GHz have revealed a larger-scale, edge-brightened jet with clear signatures of non-thermal emission. The theoretical modelling of these observations involves advanced general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetized accretion disks around rotating black holes, together with the associated synchrotron emission, which is normally treated with simplified expressions for the electron temperature and assuming a purely thermal distribution. However, an important non-thermal component is expected to be present, making the thermal-emission model not only an approximation, but also a source of degeneracy in the modelling. In view of this, we here present the first application of an ab-initio approach to the electron temperature derived from microscopic simulations of turbulent collisionless plasmas. The novel method, which has no tuneable coefficients and is fully specified by the thermodynamical and magnetic properties of the plasma, provides a better description of the jet morphology and width at 86 GHz, as well as of the broadband spectral emission. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating microscopic plasma physics in black-hole imaging and emphasise the crucial role of magnetic reconnection in electron heating and acceleration processes.

Abstract: The galaxy cluster RXC J0032.1+1808 has been well-studied with optical imaging and gravitational lensing mass maps, both of which reveal an elongated morphology in the north-south direction. We find that its X-ray morphology is bimodal, suggesting that it is in the process of merging; combined with a previously reported detection of a radio relic, we suggest that the system is seen after first pericenter. We extract the global X-ray temperature and unabsorbed luminosity from archival XMM-Newton data, finding $T_X=8.5^{+1.1}_{-0.9}$ keV and $L_X=1.04 \pm 0.03 \times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 90\% confidence in the $0.5$--$10.0$ keV energy range. We conduct a redshift survey of member galaxies and find that the line-of-sight relative velocity between the two subclusters is $76\pm364$ km/s. We use publicly available hydrodynamic simulations to show that it cannot be a head-on merger, that it is observed ${\approx}395$--560 Myr after pericenter, and that the viewing angle must be one that foreshortens the apparent subcluster separation by a factor ${\approx}2$.

Abstract: Radio pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments using millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are beginning to detect nHz gravitational waves (GWs). MSPs are bright GeV gamma-ray emitters, and all-sky monitoring of about 100 MSPs with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has enabled a gamma-ray Pulsar Timing Array. The GPTA provides a complementary view of nHz GWs because its MSP sample is different, and because the gamma-ray data are immune to plasma propagation effects, have minimal data gaps, and rely on homogeneous instrumentation. To assess GPTA performance for future gamma-ray observatories, we simulated the population of Galactic MSPs and developed a high-fidelity method to predict their gamma-ray spectra. This combination reproduces the properties of the LAT MSP sample, validating it for future population studies. We determined the expected signal from the simulated gamma-ray MSPs for instrument concepts with a wide range of capabilities. We found that the optimal GPTA energy range runs about 0.1 to 5 GeV, but we also examined Compton/MeV instruments. With the caveat that the MSP spectra models are extrapolated beyond observational constraints, we found low signal-to-background ratios, yielding few MSP detections. GeV-band concepts would detect 10$^3$ to 10$^4$ MSPs and achieve GW sensitivity on par with and surpassing the current generation of radio PTAs, reaching the GW self-noise regime. When considering two possible scenarios for the formation of MSPs in the Galactic bulge, the collective signal from which is a potential source of an excess GeV signal observed towards the Galactic center, we find that most of the concepts can both detect this bulge population and distinguish the production channel. In summary, the high discovery potential, strong GW performance, and tremendous synergy with radio PTAs all argue for the pursuit of next-generation gamma-ray pulsar timing.

Abstract: Relativistic transients such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), jetted tidal disruption events, luminous fast blue optical transients, and fast X-ray transients, represent the brightest explosions in the Universe and serve dual roles as laboratories for extreme physics and as cosmic lighthouses probing the earliest epochs of the Universe. The 2040s will bring transformative capabilities: wide-field optical surveys discovering tens of thousands of optical transients nightly, proposed high-energy missions like THESEUS providing 10-100x improved high-energy monitoring, and third-generation gravitational wave detectors identifying $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ compact object mergers annually, many accompanied by relativistic jets. This industrial-scale discovery rate will enable population studies addressing fundamental questions such as jet launching mechanisms, nucleosynthesis, the first stars, and how progenitor environments shape these transients across cosmic time. However, realizing this science requires overcoming a critical bottleneck: these transients evolve on timescales of seconds to days, with their physics encoded in rapidly-changing multi-wavelength signatures demanding immediate spectroscopic characterization down to m ~ 25. Current facilities, optimized for classical/queue scheduling, do not provide the rapid, flexible, multi-target response necessary for industrial-scale follow-up. This white paper demonstrates that without a dedicated large-aperture (10-30 m effective collecting area) time-domain facility with robotic scheduling and optical-NIR spectroscopic capabilities, the transformative potential of relativistic transient science in the 2040s will be considerably limited.

Abstract: Supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) are characterized by persistent thermonuclear burning on the surfaces of white dwarfs (WDs).The standard model requires high mass transfer rates of $\sim 10^{-7}\, {\rm M_{\odot}}\,yr^{-1}$ from massive companions, presenting a theoretical impediment to the observed short-period SSSs, whose orbital periods imply low-mass donors theoretically incapable of sustaining such accretion.To resolve this paradox,we propose and demonstrate through detailed simulations that irradiative feedback following a classical nova (CN) eruption provides a natural formation channel.Through detailed binary evolution simulations with MESA, we reveal that sustained WD irradiation initially from the outburst and subsequently from accretion luminosity triggers significant and stable expansion of the low mass companion.This,in turn,drives mass-transfer rates into the stable hydrogen-burning regime and sustains it beyond $10^4$ years after the initiation of hydrogen burning.This mechanism robustly explains the observed population of short-period SSSs. Moreover,when irradiation-driven mass transfer rate drops below the stable accretion rate,it may lead to the rapid accumulation of sufficient material on shorter time scales to trigger a recurrent nova outburst instead of SSS, thereby also offering an explanation for the origin of short-period recurrent novae.

Guided by analytic scalings and 3D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we show that the pulsar "Fundamental Plane" (relating gamma-ray luminosity, spectral cutoff energy, spin-down power $\dot{\cal{E}}$, and surface magnetic field) is bounded by two regimes: a radiation-reaction-limited branch and a potential-drop-limited branch. Their intersection defines a transition in $\dot{\cal{E}}$ that maps to a gamma-ray visibility threshold on the $P-\dot{P}$ diagram, above which detectability is set by distance and beaming, and below which both cutoff energy and efficiency decline rapidly. Placing ATNF pulsars and McGill magnetars onto these planes reproduces the observed Fermi occupancy, with millisecond pulsars (MSPs) on the observable side, young pulsars (YPs) straddling the threshold, and magnetars clustering at or just below it. At higher $\dot{\cal{E}}$, both MSPs and YPs depart from the maximal radiation-reaction-limited envelope at similar cutoff energies, suggesting that enhanced pair creation screens the accelerating electric field in the ECS. We interpret this behavior with a compactness-based criterion for optically thin $γγ$ pair feedback in or near the ECS and briefly note an extension to $γγ\rightarrowμ^\pm$ that could yield pulsed multi-TeV neutrinos in the most energetic systems. The framework predicts an MeV-bright, GeV-faint corridor below current Fermi sensitivity, a target for next-generation MeV missions. Finally, motivated by the recent HESSII detection of pulsed multi-TeV emission from Vela, we use PIC particle distributions with a simple seed-photon model to reproduce a multi-TeV inverse-Compton component alongside the GeV curvature emission, supporting a unified ECS-based GeV-TeV origin.

Abstract: Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to occur in star-forming regions. The multiwavelength follow-up observations of the early afterglow of GRB 240825A provided insights into the evolution of the optical-to-X-ray spectral feature of the afterglow. We comprehensively investigate the evolution of X-ray spectral properties through time-resolved spectral analysis and calculate optical darkness ($β_\mathrm{OX}$) to reveal the physical properties of the afterglow. The X-ray-to-optical SEDs of afterglow in different time intervals are fitted to derive the extinction curves. The $β_\mathrm{OX}$ exhibits a trend of decreasing and then increasing, reaching its minimum value at $\sim1000\mathrm{\,s}$ post-trigger. However, at 11 hours post-trigger, $β_\mathrm{OX}$ does not meet the criteria for an optically dark burst. The extinction curves in different time intervals indicate that GRB 240825A occurred in a dust-obscured environment.

Abstract: This proceedings paper reports on the theoretical modelling of particle acceleration in magnetised turbulent plasmas. It briefly reviews some recent findings obtained from fully kinetic numerical simulations of large-amplitude, semi to fully relativistic turbulence. The paper then argues that these findings can be understood within the framework of a ``generalised Fermi'' picture of stochastic acceleration, which it summarises. The dominant contributions to acceleration appear to arise from particle interactions with sharp, dynamic bends of the magnetic field lines and regions of velocity compression. Interestingly, the acceleration rate is spatially inhomogeneous and its probability distribution follows a broken power law extending up to large values. This makes relativistic, large-amplitude turbulence an extreme particle accelerator. Some implications for particle transport and the shape of the particle energy spectrum in the presence of radiative losses and over long timescales are also discussed.

Abstract: In 2010, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope observed two gamma-ray emitting structures, the Fermi Bubbles (FBs), that extend up to 55° above and below the Galactic plane and that seem to emanate from the Galactic center region. Although the spectrum at latitudes |b| > 10° has a softening or a cutoff around 100 GeV, the one at the base of the FBs, |b| <10°, extends up to about 1 TeV without a significant cutoff in the Fermi LAT data. The mechanism behind the FBs production is currently under debate. More observations of the FBs at different energies are required to improve our understanding of their origin.
  Recently, H.E.S.S. and HAWC observatory have set upper limits on the FBs. In this work, we assess the sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) using the "alpha configuration" in the South site to detect the FBs and investigate the optimal strategies for their detection at low latitudes. We simulate the observations using the official CTAO science tool gammapy, considering several benchmark models for the FBs and the interstellar emission and test different observational strategies taking advantage of the proposed CTAO consortium surveys. We use these simulations to estimate the CTAO sensitivity to the FBs.

Abstract: This work explores whether hadronic processes could be responsible for the high-energy emission seen in quasars identified by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) instrument aboard the Fermi satellite. In contrast to purely leptonic models, this work investigates whether hadronic mechanisms can explain the observed gamma-ray spectra by analyzing the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of a chosen sample of FSRQs (Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasars). By incorporating both hadronic and leptonic components into their multi-wavelength modeling, we evaluate the model's feasibility to simultaneously describe the data collected by Fermi-LAT and neutrinos detected by IceCube. According to the results, a hadronic contribution would be required to explain the SED of quasars detected by Fermi-LAT. However, their contribution to the neutrino flux detected by IceCube remains understated.
