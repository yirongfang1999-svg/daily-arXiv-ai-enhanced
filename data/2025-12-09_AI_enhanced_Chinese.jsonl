The spacetime around a rotating braneworld black hole is modelled by a Kerr-Newman-like metric determined by its mass $M$, spin $a$, and tidal charge $q$, which encodes the gravitational effects of the bulk spacetime. We consider both inhomogeneous and homogeneous plasma environments characterized by plasma parameters $\u03b1_i$ ($i=1,2\\text{ and }3$) to study light propagation and the interplay of the background spacetime and the plasma environment in influencing the shadow size and shape. We find that as the plasma density increases, inhomogeneous plasma environments decrease the shadow size, however homogeneous plasma enlarges it. On studying the effect due to background spacetime we find that $q<0$ (negative tidal charge) increases the shadow diameter, while $q>0$ decreases it. Using the EHT measurements of M87* and Sgr A*, we constrain the $(q,\u03b1_i)$ parameter space. The EHT data constrains the tidal charge in the range $-1.15 \\lesssim q \\lesssim 0.45$ for M87* and $-0.65 \\lesssim q \\lesssim 0.8$ for Sgr A* in the low density plasma limit. As the plasma density increases, the data exhibits a preference towards negative tidal charge for inhomogeneous plasma environments and positive tidal charge for homogeneous plasma environments. Our study reveals that the size of the shadow is primarily governed by the background geometry in presence of low density plasma environments such as that observed in M87* and Sgr A*. However, if supermassive blackholes are surrounded by high density plasma then the shadow size is dictated by both the background metric and the plasma environment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In the framework of the apparent phantom crossing, we also propose a new scenario, where the particle corresponding to the scalar field in the scalar--Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet gravity is dark matter. The mass of the particle might increase due to the coupling with the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, which makes the decrease of the dark matter energy density slower.

We report the first X-ray detections of the dusty WC+O binary system WR 112 from Chandra and Swift, alongside 27 years of VLA/ATCA radio monitoring and new diffraction-limited Keck images. Because we view the nearly circular orbit almost edge-on, the colliding-wind zone alternates between heavy Wolf-Rayet wind self-absorption and a near-transparent O-star wind foreground each 20-yr orbit, producing phase-locked radio and X-ray variability. This scenario leads to a prediction that the radio spectral index is flatter from a larger non-thermal contribution around the radio intensity maximum, which is indeed observed. Existing models that assume a single dust-expansion speed fail to reproduce the combined infrared geometry and radio light curve. Instead, we require an accelerating post-shock flow that climbs from near-stationary to ~1350 km/s in about one orbital cycle, naturally matching the infrared spiral from about 5\" down to within 0.1\", while also fitting the phase of the radio brightening.

This classification may be biased, as some apparently non-repeating sources could simply have undetected subsequent bursts. To address this, we develop a semi-supervised learning framework to identify distinguishing features of repeaters using primary observational parameters from the Blinkverse database, which draws from the CHIME/FRB Catalogs. The framework combines labeled data (known repeaters and confidently classified non-repeaters) with unlabeled sources previously flagged as non-repeaters but exhibiting repeater-like characteristics. We employ uniform manifold approximation and projection with a nearest-neighbor scheme to select potential candidates, followed by semi-supervised classification using five base estimators, including random forest, support vector machine, logistic regression, AdaBoost, and Gradient boost. Each model is fine-tuned through cross-validation, and a voting strategy among the five models is employed to enhance robustness. All models achieve consistently high performance, identifying dispersion measure, peak frequency, and fluence as the most discriminative features. Repeaters tend to show lower dispersion measures, higher peak frequencies, and higher fluences than non-repeaters. We also identify a set of candidate repeaters, several of which are consistent with prior independent studies. Our approach can identify 36 additional repeater candidates that conventional methods may have missed.

In particular, we prove a parity-of-crossings property: any admissible geodesic that traverses an even number of ring singularities returns to its original sheet, while an odd number of traversals terminates on the opposite sheet.\n  Generalising to $N$ disjoint ring singularities, we prove that the fundamental group of the excised manifold is the free group $F_N$ generated by simple loops around each ring, and we classify the associated double covers. Identifying the physically distinguished cover where every ring induces a sheet exchange, we extend the parity-of-crossings theorem to the multi-ring setting. We then formally extend these results to the maximal analytic extension (the infinite Carter--Penrose chain), proving that the sheet-exchange mechanism applies globally to this infinite structure.\n  Finally, applying the Novikov self-consistency principle to this topological framework, we demonstrate that the requirement of global consistency restricts admissible histories to discrete sectors labelled by ring-crossing parities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We show that the approach used to obtain many of these metrics generically does not lead to the correct solutions to the Einstein equations for the matter sources they purport to represent. This issue originates from applying the Newtonian relation between the tangential velocity and the enclosed mass directly within a relativistic framework, followed by the ad hoc assumption $g(r)=f(r)$ for the metric functions. This procedure leads to an anisotropic fluid with $P_r=-\u03c1$ and $P_t=-r\u03c1'/2-\u03c1$, whose density differs from the claimed halo profile and often becomes non-physical near the horizon, violating the weak energy condition. As a result, the obtained spacetimes do not describe black holes embedded in known galactic halos but rather distinct anisotropic configurations unrelated to the intended matter distribution. We demonstrate this problem on several representative examples from the literature, including metrics based on the NFW, Burkert, Einasto, solitonic, pseudo-isothermal, and Dehnen-(1,4,5/2) profiles, as well as the case of the NGC~4649 halo.

As in the previous work, we employ the analytic Fisher-Cutler-Vallisneri method to calculate the systematic bias that can be produced by using noneccentric waveforms in parameter estimation, and we verify the reliability of the method by comparing it with numerical Bayesian parameter estimation results. We generate $10^4$ BNS sources randomly distributed in the parameter space $m_1$-$m_2$-$\u03c7_{\\rm eff}$-$e_0$, where the nuetron star mass is in the range of $1 M_\\odot \\leq m_{1,2}\\leq 2M_\\odot (m_2 \\leq m_1)$, the effective spin is $-0.2 \\leq \u03c7_{\\rm eff} \\leq0 .2$, and the eccentricity (at the reference frequency 10 Hz) is $0 \\leq e_0 \\leq 0.024$. For the true value of the tidal deformability ($\u03bb$) of neutron stars, we assume the equation of state model APR4. For all gravitational-wave signals emitted from the sources, we calculate the systematic biases ($\u0394\u03b8$) for the chirp mass ($M_c$), symmetric mass ratio ($\u03b7$), effective spin ($\u03c7_{\\rm eff}$), and effective tidal deformability ($\\tilde\u03bb$), and obtain generalized distributions of the biases. The distribution of biases in $M_c, \u03b7$, and $\u03c7_{\\rm eff}$ shows narrow bands that increase or decrease quadratically with increasing $e_0$, indicating a weak dependence of biases on the three parameters. On the other hand, the biases of $\\tilde\u03bb$ are widely distributed depending on the values of the mass and spin parameters at a given $e_0$. We investigate the implications of biased parameters for the inference of neutron star properties by performing Bayesian parameter estimation for specific cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In parallel, we track the acceleration of cosmic-ray electrons (CRe) via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) at merger-driven shocks, together with radiative cooling and Fermi-II (turbulent) acceleration in the postshock region, employing a high-order Fokker-Planck solver. Synchrotron emission is computed from the simulated CRe distribution and magnetic fields. In this paper, we detail these numerical approaches and present the first results obtained with them. Two prominent axial shocks emerge along the merger axis; the shock ahead of the heavier subcluster systematically attains a higher Mach number, although it is more compact, than that ahead of the lighter subcluster. Turbulent magnetic fields--both inherited from the initial condition and amplified during the merger--produce patchy, fine-scale structures in the radio surface brightness. Because of the combined effects of turbulent acceleration, spatially nonuniform magnetic fields, and the curved geometry of merger shocks, the volume-integrated radio spectra show deviations from the canonical power-law steepening expected for a planar shock with a uniform field. Reacceleration of preexisting fossil CRe enhances the surface brightness.

We aim to quantitatively determine the extent to which the orbital properties of test particles in the gravity of a spinning wormhole may differ from those of a Kerr black hole. We seek to find an observable related to disk accretion that would be clearly different for Kerr black holes and Kerr-like wormholes. We use the standard Lagrangian approach to derive the orbital properties of test particles from an effective potential. We use standard thin disk theory to infer the disk surface temperature. We find that at a given circumferential radius the physical quantities relating to circular orbits in the equatorial plane are exactly the same for the spinning wormhole and a black hole of the same mass and angular momentum, if only the two space-time metrics differ in the g_rr component alone. However, for a wormhole there are no orbits of radius less than that of its throat. Non-circular orbits, bound or unbound, are affected by the radial distance function; in particular, the angle of apsidal precession in Kerr-like wormholes will differ from that in Kerr black holes. A Kerr-like wormhole is a perfect black hole mimicker in relation to the orbital properties in the equatorial plane. The angular velocity, specific energy, specific angular momentum, and Lense-Thirring precession rate are the same for a Kerr black hole and a Kerr-like wormhole in circular orbits of the same circumference.

In this study, a local existence result is established, describing the dynamics in a neighbourhood of such caustics. Specifically, we obtain spherically symmetric spacetimes $(M,g_{\u03bc\u03bd})$ containing a caustic $\\mathcal{C}$, which, in the quotient $M/SO(3)$, is a timelike curve forming a singular boundary between a 2-dust region and a vacuum region. The spacetimes are constructed from solutions to a PDE problem posed with a spacelike direction of evolution. Curvature invariants and energy densities diverge as the caustic is approached. Consequently the metric has limited regularity $g\\in C^{1,1/2}$ and is shown to satisfy Einstein's equation weakly. On the complement of the caustic, the metric is smooth and satisfies Einstein's equation classically. A (degenerate) coordinate system is identified in which the dynamical variables are smooth with extension to the caustic. Finally, a novel family of static, spherically symmetric spacetimes is identified, complementing the local construction above. Each spacetime contains an eternal annular 2-dust region bounded by a pair of caustics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This inequality is derived through an analysis of the roots of the identity which holds among the thermodynamic variables to avoid a naked singularity. We have analyzed the Kerr-AdS black hole and the asymptotically AdS uncharged and rotating black strings and find strong supporting evidence for different horizon topologies. Using this inequality we verify the validity of reverse isoperimetric inequality in its conventional form ($ {\\cal R}\\geq 1 $) in the presence of rotation. By examining a wide range of black hole solutions, we confirm the validity of the proposed inequality. Assuming that reverse isoperimetric inequality continues to hold in higher dimensions, and employing the intermediate refined reverse isoperimetric inequalities introduced in [\\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.241401}{Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 131}, 241401}] as guiding principles, we extend the inequality to higher-dimensional spacetimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
