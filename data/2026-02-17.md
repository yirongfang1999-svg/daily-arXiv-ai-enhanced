Abstract: The landmark multi-messenger observations of the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 provided firm evidence that such mergers can produce short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). However, the limited number of BNS detections by current gravitational-wave (GW) observatories raises the question of whether BNS mergers alone can account for the full observed sGRB population. We analyze a comprehensive set of 64 BNS population synthesis models with a Monte Carlo-based framework to reproduce the properties of sGRBs detected by Fermi-GBM over the past 16 years. We consider three jet geometry scenarios: a universal structured jet calibrated to GW170817, a universal top-hat jet, and a non-universal top-hat jet with distributions of core opening angles. Our results show that models characterized by low local BNS merger rates ($R_{BNS}(0) \lesssim 50$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$) predict too few observable sGRBs to reproduce the Fermi-GBM population, effectively disfavoring them as sole progenitors. Even when relaxing assumptions on jet geometry, low-rate models remain viable only for wide jets ($θ_c \ge 15^\circ$), in tension with the narrow jet cores ($θ_c \approx 6^\circ$) inferred from sGRB afterglow observations. In contrast, models with local merger rates of order $R_{BNS}(0) \approx 100$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ successfully reproduce the observed sGRB population, assuming a plausible fraction of BNS mergers launch relativistic jets and realistic jet geometries. This analysis highlights the power of combining GW observations of BNS mergers with electromagnetic observations of sGRBs to place robust constraints on the BNS merger population and to assess their role as progenitors of sGRBs.

Abstract: The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) monitors sources within its field of view for up to 7 hours daily, achieving a duty cycle exceeding 98% and an annual point-source sensitivity of 1.5% Crab Units (CU) in the very high energy (VHE) band. This unbiased sky-survey mode facilitates systematic monitoring and investigation of outburst phenomena. In this paper, we present results from an unprecedented three-year monitoring campaign (March 2021--March 2024) of Mrk421 using LHAASO, spanning energies from 0.4 TeV to 20 TeV. We find that the blazar stayed in a quiescent state in 2021 and became active starting in 2022 with a total of 23 VHE outburst events identified, where the highest observed daily significance reaches $20\,σ$ with a flux equivalent to approximately 3.3~CU. LHAASO's continuous monitoring suggests the flaring occupancy of Mrk~421 to be around 14%. During long-term monitoring, multiwavelength (MWL) variability and correlation analyses are conducted using complementary data from Fermi-LAT, MAXI-GSC, Swift-XRT, and ZTF. A significant correlation ($>3\,σ$) is observed between X-ray and VHE bands with no detectable time lag, while the correlation between GeV and TeV bands is weaker. The flux distribution of the TeV emission during the quiescent state is different from that in the active state, implying the existence of two modes of energy dissipation in the blazar jet. Using simultaneous MWL data, we also analyzed both the long-term and outburst-period SEDs, and discussed the possible origin of the outburst events.

Abstract: With the forth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave network, which enabled the discovery of the kilonova (KN) counterpart to GW170817, ending with no new confirmed neutron star mergers, the intrinsic rate of these events must be even lower than previously estimated. As a result, building a sample of KNe will remain challenging even with continued GW observations, motivating complementary discovery strategies that do not rely on gravitational-wave triggers. In this work, we consider how leveraging bright short gamma-ray burst afterglows can aid in the discovery on KNe with the Rubin Observatory's upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), whose unprecedented depth will make such detections feasible. We find that nearly on-axis ($θ_{\rm view} \leq 30°$) afterglows can enhance KN detection rates in the LSST $g$-band from $29^{+51}_{-21} \ \rm yr^{-1}$ to $91^{+160}_{-65} \ \rm yr^{-1}$. We further show how the colors of the observed events can be used to distinguish between neutron star merger counterparts with and without KN emission. This study demonstrates how critical multi-wavelength and multi-survey observations are for these rare events, especially without context from gravitational waves. Fortunately, detectable events will likely be discovered near peak with LSST, allowing for rapid follow-up and confirmation. We discuss key uncertainties in our study, particularly volume rate of merger events, and the degeneracy between the empirically determined explosion energy and ambient medium density.

Abstract: Neutron stars in globular clusters follow complex evolutionary pathways shaped by binary interactions, mass transfer, and dynamical exchanges. Direct N-body simulations such as NBODY6++GPU successfully model stellar dynamics and compact object formation, but they usually do not track pulsar spin evolution or magnetic field decay explicitly. Building on Papers I and II of this series, we identify this gap and present a case study from an existing simulation with N = 105000 particles, showing how a neutron star forms and evolves for 200 Myr without any pulsar-physics tracking. We compare this situation with recent implementations and outline a seven-scenario framework that includes magnetic dipole spin-down, exponential magnetic field decay, environmental torques, accretion-driven spin-up, gravitational-wave emission, and merger-driven evolution. As an example, the neutron star we label Pulsar973 forms at t = 800 Myr with a post-supernova mass of 5.35 solar masses and evolves to 2.52 solar masses by t = 1000 Myr, but still lacks period P, period derivative Pdot, magnetic field B, and scenario classification. We provide mathematical formulations and specific integration points within NBODY6++GPU (Hermite scheme, Ahmad-Cohen neighbors, KS regularization, and BSE stellar evolution) to enable scenario-based pulsar evolution within direct N-body simulations.

Abstract: GPM 1839-10 is an intriguing long-period radio transient (LPT), distinguished by its activity spanning at least three decades and its highly unusual emission characteristics. These features include orthogonal polarization mode (OPM) switches, down-drifting sub-structures, and distinct linear-to-circular polarization conversion behaviors. In this work, we present follow-up observations utilizing the FAST telescope at L-band, yielding a total of seven detected radio pulses. We find a consistent association between OPM switches and a decrease in polarized intensity. This feature strongly supports the hypothesis that the OPM switches are generated by the incoherent summation of OPMs. Our measured Rotation Measures (RMs) are consistent with previous observations, indicating that the magneto-ionic environment is stable. If the source is in a binary system, such stability suggests it may host a weakly magnetized companion. Crucially, we firstly observe clear evidence of a cyclotron absorption feature in one radio pulse, a signature rarely observed in radio sources. This feature allows us to infer that the magnetic field strength at the absorption site has a lower limit of tens of Gauss, which is necessary for the phenomenon to occur. This characteristic can be explained in a scenario where GPM 1839-10 possesses a weakly magnetized companion star.

Abstract: The presence of dust in supernova remnants (SNRs) is confirmed by extensive infrared data from observatories such as Spitzer, Herschel, and JWST, alongside theoretical models of dust formation. This study explores the existence of dust and ices, particularly water ice via 62 μm in SNRs such as the Crab Nebula and N49, using observational data and preliminary modeling with Cloudy. Observations suggest that water ice may be present in IC 443 and possibly other remnants, though the 63 μm band could also indicate [OI] emission. Theoretical models indicate that water ice could survive under certain conditions in SNRs, with densities and temperatures analyzed. Further observations and refined simulations are needed to confirm these findings.

Abstract: Water ice has been detected in several supernova remnants despite the strong heating and radiation in these environments. This challenges standard expectations for dust survival. Using two dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we study how a supernova shock interacts with a dense interstellar cloud. The simulations show that the shock naturally compresses the cloud into dense structures similar to those inferred in well known remnants. Although temperatures remain high in the adiabatic phase, simple considerations indicate that cooling would act quickly once included. These results suggest that shock cloud interactions create the physical conditions needed for water ice to form. Future work including radiative cooling and grain surface chemistry will allow direct modelling of ice growth in these compressed regions.

Abstract: The past decade has been a transformative period for pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) and their search for nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs). This progress has been driven by collective advances in instrumentation for pulsar timing observations, increasingly sophisticated data-analysis techniques, and improved theoretical understanding of the origins of nanohertz GW signals. PTA sensitivity has steadily improved, leading first to progressively more stringent upper limits on the gravitational-wave background (GWB), and subsequently to the identification of a common red-noise process in pulsar timing data, the first hint of a GWB. In 2023, multiple PTA collaborations reported evidence for the Hellings-Downs correlation, widely regarded as the definitive signature of a GWB. These developments place PTAs on the threshold of a confident GW detection and the opening of a new low-frequency window on the GW Universe. In this article, we present an overview of PTA experiments, with particular emphasis on the rapid progress achieved during this pivotal period for PTA and nanohertz GW science.

Abstract: We investigate the potential birthplace of Galactic binary neutron star (BNS) systems through a kinematic analysis. Using high-precision astrometry from Gaia DR3, updated pulsar distances, and Monte Carlo sampling of astrometric errors, we integrate the past trajectories of 11 Galactic BNSs and 167 globular clusters plus 2967 open clusters, to search for past encounters. Our results suggest that BNS origin in globular clusters is unlikely, with low encounter probabilities (e.g., $\lesssim 0.5\%$ for NGC 5139) and requiring excessive ejection velocities. Conversely, our analysis indicates that open clusters are a non-negligible formation channel. Specifically, the double pulsar J0737$-$3039 shows a $13.9\%$ ($5.4\%$) probability of originating from the young cluster OC 0450 (Theia 58). Based on encounter proximity and time, we argue that Theia 58 is its more plausible birthplace. Our work provides kinematic evidence consistent with an open-cluster origin for a subset of field BNSs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We develop a self-consistent nonlinear extension of diffusive shock acceleration that incorporates cosmic ray (CR) backreaction on the shock precursor together with a physically motivated upstream-escape mechanism that produces an exponential high energy cutoff. The CR pressure gradient decelerates the upstream flow facing the shock wave, generating an extended precursor in which higher rigidity particles sample a larger cumulative velocity gradient and thereby acquire a progressively harder spectrum. Finite-size/escape effects are modeled by a momentum-dependent loss term, which naturally terminates acceleration and steepens the spectrum near the cutoff. The precursor compression ratio is not imposed as a closure condition but is determined dynamically by requiring consistency between the injection rate inferred from thermal leakage at the subshock and the injection strength demanded by the nonlinear shock modification, with CR-driven wave heating providing stabilizing negative feedback. Applying the model to young supernova-remnant-like parameters and standard one-zone Galactic diffusion, we reproduce the main features of the latest DAMPE proton spectrum: gradual hardening from hundreds of GeV to multi-TeV energies and a subsequent exponential cutoff at tens of TeV. The resulting spectral evolution follows directly from the competition between precursor-mediated nonlinear feedback and upstream escape.

Abstract: We report the Fe K relativistic reverberation feature for the first time in the Narrow-line Seyfert\,1 galaxy Ton\,S180. Using a long observation from {\it XMM-Newton} we find that the Fe K emission lag peaks at $117\pm49$ s in the lag energy spectrum computed for frequencies $(0.3-8.5) \times 10^{-4}$ Hz. The lag amplitude drops to $22.85\pm14.20$ s as the frequency increases to $(8.5-30) \times 10^{-4}$ Hz. The time-averaged spectrum of the source shows a relatively narrow Fe K line at $\sim6.4$ keV, resulting in black hole spin to be low ($a=\rm 0.43_{-0.14}^{+0.10}$) found from the reflection modelling. We perform general relativistic transfer function modelling of the lag energy spectra individually. This provides an independent timing-based measure of the spin at $a=0.30_{-0.17}^{+0.34}$, and black hole mass $M_{\rm BH} = 0.29_{-0.16}^{+0.01}\times10^8M_{\odot}$, comparable to the previous measurement, and height of the corona $h = 2.59_{-0.33}^{+5.17}r_{\rm g}$. Further, we observe that the Fe K lag and the black hole mass fit well in the linear lag-mass relation shown by other Seyfert 1 galaxies.

Abstract: The SS433, a well-known binary system with an internal black hole, have shown since half a century, an inner (a few year light distances) twin precessing jets spirals. These beams are made by tidal forces while stripping mass from large stellar companion feeding an inner BH accretion disk and an orthogonal accelerating twin jet. From it, the radio, X gamma jet emission. A couple of years ago H.E.S.S telescope as well as HAWC and LHAASO array detectors, discovered also the surprising signature of an unexpected far twin separated gamma beam at tens TeV energy. At a hundred light years distances from its central source. We suggest that it is the legacy of a past rare eruption, a century ago, of tens PeV (10^16 eV) relativistic twin neutron beams. Their beta decay in flight at far distances, into proton, neutrino and in particular into tens TeV electrons, could feed the observed TeV gamma traces. They are originated by the same secondary tens TeV electrons emitting hard gamma, by Inverse Compton Scattering onto interstellar infrared photons.

Abstract: We demonstrate that magnetospheric interactions between merging neutron stars (NSs) generate dual-jetted current outflows, analogous to the Alfvén wings observed during planetary interactions in the Solar System. Using 3D relativistic MHD simulations, we model the interaction as a conducting sphere moving through a highly magnetized plasma of the companion's magnetosphere. Unusually, the interaction operates in a regime that is relativistic yet sub-Alfvénic. Electromagnetic draping amplifies magnetic fields in a narrow layer near the stellar surface, leading to the generation of electric currents along the local magnetic field. The generation of beamed outflows enhances instantaneous power of the pulsar-like radio and high energy emission, produces spin/orbital modulations, and is likely to lead to observable precursor emission preceding the main gravitational wave event.

Abstract: By identifying quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) reported in FRB 20240114A (from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope) with neutron star crustal torsional oscillations, together with experimental constraints on the incompressibility $K_0$ of symmetric nuclear matter at saturation density, we constrain the mass and radius of an extragalactic neutron star at redshift $z\approx0.13$. Identifying the low-order QPO frequencies as fundamental oscillations, and frequencies of $567.7\,\mathrm{Hz}$ or $655.5\,\mathrm{Hz}$ (rest frame) as first overtone candidates, implies neutron star mass ranges of $1.00$--$1.55\,M_\odot$ or $1.17$--$1.76\,M_\odot$, respectively. The radius is also constrained, with a self-consistent value around $13$~km, further supported by the calculation of the NS structure within the low-mass/low-central density regime. Simultaneously, we also constrain another nuclear saturation parameter, namely the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy at saturation density (i.e., the slope parameter), $L$, and determine it to be $L=59.5-96.8$ MeV with $\sim 10\%$ systematic uncertainty, which is broadly consistent with previous constraints on $L$ obtained from experiments and astronomical observations. Thus, a mapping of FRB QPOs to crustal torsional modes seems reasonable. This can be confirmed with upcoming FRB surveys over a broad range of redshifts and more elaborate data analyses.

Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of the radiative properties and optical appearance of rotating SV black holes surrounded by a thin accretion disks, and mainly analyze the influence of the regularization parameter $g$ on related observables. The results show that although the kinetic quantities and the location of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) depend on the regularization parameter $g$, the radiative efficiency of the rotating SV black hole is the same as its Kerr counterpart. Within the Novikov-Thorne thin-disk model, the radiative flux, effective temperature, and spectral luminosity are studied, and by adopting observational parameters relevant to SgrA* and M87*, concrete examples of the rotating SV black holes are calculated and compared with that of the Kerr black holes. The results show that the parameter $g$ suppresses the maximum values of these quantities. In addition, using a backward ray-tracing technique, we numerically simulate the optical appearance of rotating SV black holes and analyze the corresponding intensity images, redshift and observed flux distributions. Our results show that these quantities are affected by $g$. In particular, as $g$ increases, the observed intensity is significantly suppressed and the photon ring region has remarkable increase in its width. Our findings suggest that accretion-disk-related observables may provide important avenues to distinguish rotating SV black holes and Kerr black holes, and offer theoretical guidance for future high-resolution observations.

Abstract: In a recent arXiv posting [1] I reported the result of an experiment: asking Perplexity.ai to compare three items concerning (ordinary) Gamma Ray Burts (GRBs): the data, the standard paradigm(s) and the "Cannonball" (CB) model. Here I ask the same URL to extend this comparison to long--lasting GRBs, binary Neutron-Star mergers and their associated short--hard GRBs, low--luminosity GRBs, X--ray flashes, X--ray transients, and non--solar cosmic rays. The results of this experiment are enlightening but worrisome. Except for this abstract, two footnotes and two other references to standard [2] and CB-model [3] articles and talks, all of what follows is, verbatim, what the cited AI "opines".

Abstract: Quantum gravity theories often modify spacetime symmetries. In particular, Lorentz invariance may be violated when approaching the Planck scale. Although the scales at which interactions occur in extensive air showers induced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in the atmosphere are many orders of magnitude below the Planck scale, these violations might still be observable. In this work, the fluctuations in the number of muons in the extensive air showers measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory are exploited, for the first time, to constrain Lorentz invariance violations. The bounds derived in the hadronic sector are the strongest ever obtained, and do not rely on assumptions about the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The fluctuations in the number of muons constitute a new and powerful observable to further explore Lorentz invariance in a region of the parameter space not accessible to other observables.

Abstract: HESS J0852-463 is a TeV γ-ray source located in the Galactic plane. The region consists of a supernova remnant (SNR, RX J0852.0-4622) with a shell-like morphology, commonly referred to as Vela Junior, and a pulsar denoted PSR J0855-4644. Pulsars are among the most efficient leptonic accelerators in our Galaxy, making this region particularly interesting to study. We utilise the most recent data taken by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), to investigate any γ-ray emission associated with the pulsar in this region, PSR J0855-4644. We applied a full forward folding method on the H.E.S.S. data. Utilising 3D modelling techniques, we evaluated the TeV γ-ray emission towards the various components of this complex system. The distinct energy-dependent morphology observed in our data motivates further investigation of this source. We resolved the emission in the Vela Junior region into various components, several of which correspond to the SNR itself. In particular, we find a new extended component which is coincident with the position of PSR J0855-4644. The spectrum follows a power-law distribution with a best-fit index of ΓE = 1.81 \pm 0.07stat which differs from the properties of the surrounding γ-ray emission of the Vela Junior SNR. A one-zone leptonic joint fit between the X-rays (from XMM-Newton) and γ-rays (from H.E.S.S.) leads to a lower limit on the magnetic field of 1.6μG and a spectral index of α = 1.88 \pm 0.01, in line with expectations of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). In this paper, we report the first detection of the PWN of PSR J0855-4644 at TeV energies with the H.E.S.S. experiment at a significance of 12.2σ. This is attributed to the advanced techniques of the 3D analysis. Based on the pulsar's characteristics, its PWN is consistent with the known TeV PWNe population in the Galaxy.

Abstract: 4U 1556-60 is a low-mass X-ray binary that was discovered more than 50 years ago as a persistent X-ray source; however, very little was known about it. Recently, Gaia obtained a parallax for the optical counterpart that places 4U 1556-60 at a distance of only about 700 pc, making it one of the closest X-ray binaries known to date. This close distance drastically alters what was previously assumed about the source. We revisit 4U 1556-60 in light of the newly determined distance of 700 pc, reinterpreting its literature and presenting new X-ray and radio observations to better understand various characteristics of the system. We conclude that a scenario in which 4U 1556-60 is a candidate ultracompact neutron star X-ray binary at a distance of ~700 pc is able to explain the observed properties of the source. It resides at a persistent X-ray luminosity of ~2x10^34 erg/s, an unusual value for a typical X-ray binary, but similar to several ultracompact systems. The ratio of the X-ray to optical luminosity is very high, also suggesting a physically small accretion disk. The radio jet is undetected with a very deep upper limit of 3x10^25 erg/s, which is about 10^3 times fainter than the expected black hole jet correlation, strongly indicating a neutron star accretor. The X-ray spectrum is dominated by a power law, and the X-ray timing properties are also consistent with observations of other very low accretion rate X-ray binaries. No spin or orbital periodicity are found in the X-ray data. Future observations, especially to determine its orbital period, will further aid in understanding 4U 1556-60.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Sensitivity of searches for extended emission around gamma-ray sources is naturally limited by the precision of the knowledge of the Point Spread Function (PSF) of gamma-ray telescopes. Inaccuracies in the PSF models of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) can potentially lead to false positive detections of source extension. We explore uncertainties in the Fermi/LAT PSF by comparing the PSF models provided by the Fermi/LAT Instrument Response Functions (IRFs) with signals of bright pulsars. We compare the analytical PSF models of Fermi/LAT IRFs with pulsar data and fit the pulsar data with the same analytical model as in the Fermi/LAT IRFs to derive an improved set of PSF parameters. We then apply this revised PSF parameterisation to the search of extended emission around a blazar, Mrk 501. We find that the parameters of the analytical PSF models of Fermi/LAT IRFs are inconsistent with the pulsar data. We obtain an improved set of PSF parameters from the fits to pulsar data that is consistent with observations. We find no evidence of the previously reported extended signal around Mrk 501 if the revised PSF consistent with pulsar data is used in data analysis.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: NGC 4631 X-8 is an ultraluminous X-ray pulsar (ULXP) having a spin period of about 9.7 s, discovered using XMM-Newton observations in 2025. The pulsar is known to show one of the largest spin-up rates ($\sim 9.6 \times 10^{-8}$ s s$^{-1}$) among the ULXP population. We explore the surface magnetic field of the neutron star in this source using different models, and find that the inferred magnetic field lies in the range of about $0.3-2 \times 10^{14}$G. We study the long-term magnetic field and spin period evolution of the pulsar assuming steady accretion using prevalent theoretical mechanisms and find that the pulsar will evolve to become a millisecond pulsar having decayed magnetic field of about $\sim 10^{9}$G in about a million years. The scenario of the formation of a millisecond pulsar is also probed using an estimate of the super-Eddington duty cycle of about 14% from the literature, which suggests that the neutron star would accrete sufficient matter to become a recycled millisecond pulsar. Exploring the magnetic field as well as the spin period evolution properties of ULXPs may enable us to understand the poorly understood evolutionary features of ULXPs, shed light on one of the pathways of millisecond pulsar formation and also help us to understand transient super-Eddington accretion phases in newborn magnetars, which are believed to power energetic events such as long gamma-ray bursts and Type I superluminous supernovae.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Neutrino oscillations probe the quantum gravity interface in unique ways. While gravitational effects on neutrinos are well studied in general relativity and torsion based geometries, the symmetric teleparallel regime where gravity stems solely from non-metricity, with zero curvature and torsion has remained uncharted. In this work, we perform the first analysis of neutrino oscillations in such a spacetime. Using the reduced Kerr metric in coincident gauge for the slowly rotating and weakly gravitating spherical Sun, we derive the Dirac Hamiltonian from the generalized Dirac equation and compute the accumulated phase of neutrino mass eigenstates. There are six free coupling constants in our model. Based on certain observational inputs, we inferred upper bounds on our arbitrary coupling constants. This allowed us to simplify the otherwise cumbersome calculations to some extent. Ultimately, we computed the phase differences that play a crucial role in solar neutrino oscillations and analyzed the contributions arising from our arbitrary coupling constants. Our results establish neutrino oscillations as a novel probe of non-metricity and open a new avenue for testing symmetric teleparallel gravity through astrophysical observations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study spherically symmetric, self-similar wormhole solutions supported by colliding streams of negative-energy null dust, and their dynamical formation. Under the assumption of self-similarity, the Einstein equations reduce to a system of ordinary differential equations, which we solve numerically under boundary conditions enforcing the existence of a minimal areal radius (the throat) on constant-time hypersurfaces. For a sufficiently large throat radius, the resulting geometries remain regular at both spatial and future null infinity, while a singularity is retained in the past direction. We then construct a dynamical formation scenario by patching together three regions: a Schwarzschild black hole, negative-energy Vaidya spacetimes, and the self-similar wormhole geometry. These regions are joined across null shells using the Barrabes--Israel formalism, which provides explicit relations among the throat radius, the black hole's mass and the energy injection by the shell, demonstrating that an initial black hole can evolve into a wormhole. Our analysis generalizes the formation model for static wormhole solutions proposed by Hayward and Koyama in 2004 to non-static wormhole solutions, offering a novel perspective on the formation of regular traversable wormholes.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate static and dynamical spherically symmetric black hole solutions within the Gravity from Entropy (GfE) framework. We derive and solve the modified vacuum field equations for a static, spherically symmetric spacetime, revealing that the classical Schwarzschild geometry receives perturbative corrections scaling as $r^{-4}$. We establish that the GfE framework is consistent with current strong-field astrophysical observations. Higher-order geometric stresses inherent to the GfE vacuum drive a consistent mass-evolution profile. In the limit of large black hole mass, the theory predicts a constant background evaporation rate $ -β/24$, suggesting an inherent "entropic leakage" of the vacuum. At intermediate scales, the framework replicates the standard Hawking radiation mass-loss law as $\dot{M} \propto M^{-2}$ through a purely classical response of the modified background.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This study offers a comprehensive reconstruction of $f(T)$ gravity model with three distinct non-linear as well as novel forms employing a hybrid scale factor to depict the expansion history of the universe starting from early decelerated epoch to late-time accelerated evolution. Model parameters are rigorously constrained using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) analysis with the help of Bayesian statistics and incorporating late-time observations from BAO and Patheon+SH0ES. The investigation of dynamical parameters such as the equation of state parameter and cosmological parameters indicates alignment with an accelerated expansion phase in both the present and late time epochs. Validation is conducted by assessing the energy conditions, verifying the feasibility of the model forms with particular emphasis on the violation of the strong energy condition that indicates dark energy dominance in modified gravity scenarios. This investigation has been instrumental in determining models that remain consistent with cosmological observations and theoretical requirements. The reconstructed forms of the model effectively mimic $Λ$CDM at late times, providing significant insights into possible extensions of general relativity and bolstering $f(T)$ gravity theory as a robust explanation for cosmic acceleration.

Abstract: In this paper we use the Newtonian gravitational potential corrected by non-liner effects to obtain new bounds on graviton mass using non-linear density wave theory (NLDW). This potential differs from the gravitational potential obtained in other modified gravity theories (e.g. the weak field limit of Yukawa gravity, Modified Newtonian Dynamics, non-local theories, $Λ$ cold dark matter..). Using this model, we are able to define wavelength of the non-linear wave as an analytical solution of integrable non-linear differential equation (namely, non-linear Schrodinger equation). Assuming that the wavelength of the non-linear wave represents the graviton Compton wavelength, we have found the corresponding upper bound of graviton mass. We compare obtained result with first assessments of LIGO $\&$ Virgo collaboration and we find they are in a good agreement. Present model used to determine the upper limit of graviton mass is completely independent from other methods published until now. We have compared our result with results obtained using several chosen published methods.

Abstract: We study scalar perturbations of the rotating Teo wormhole embedded in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime and demonstrate that the radial Klein Gordon equation exhibits an emergent conformal structure. The smooth traversable throat induces a logarithmic tortoise coordinate that allows the radial equation to be recast as the quadratic Casimir eigenvalue equation, paralleling the hidden conformal symmetry of the rotating Kerr black hole but arising here in a horizonless geometry. The AdS-Teo spacetime possesses two disconnected timelike AdS conformal boundaries that remain causally connected through the wormhole throat, in contrast to the two-sided eternal AdS black hole where horizons play a central role. Using the emergent conformal symmetry, we construct the near-throat generators, derive the effective potential, and obtain a discrete quasinormal-mode spectrum determined by regularity at the throat and standard AdS boundary conditions at infinity. The AdS embedding further enables a minimal holographic interpretation. As an explicit illustration, we compute an equal-time two-point function in the large-Delta (geodesic) limit from a regulated spacelike geodesic that traverses the wormhole, showing how the bulk geometry couples the two asymptotic boundaries. Together, these results provide a unified description of hidden conformal structure, spectral properties, and boundary correlators in a rotating, horizonless asymptotically AdS wormhole.

Abstract: This review paper comprehensively examines the influence of spatial torsion on quantum fluctuations from the perspectives of Metric-Affine Gravity (MAG) and the Stochastic Variational Method (SVM). We first outline the fundamental framework of MAG, a generalized theory that includes both torsion and non-metricity, and discuss the geometrical significance of torsion within this context. Subsequently, we summarize SVM, a powerful technique that facilitates quantization while effectively incorporating geometrical effects. By integrating these frameworks, we evaluate how the geometrical structures originating from torsion affect quantum fluctuations, demonstrating that they induce non-linearity in quantum mechanics. Notably, torsion, traditionally believed to influence only spin degrees of freedom, can also affect spinless degrees of freedom via quantum fluctuations. Furthermore, extending beyond the results of previous work [Koide and van de Venn, Phys. Rev. A112, 052217 (2025)], we investigate the competitive interplay between the Levi-Civita curvature and torsion within the non-linearity of the Schrödinger equation. Finally, we discuss the structural parallelism between SVM and information geometry, highlighting that the splitting of time derivatives in stochastic processes corresponds to the dual connections in statistical manifolds. These insights pave the way for future extensions to gravity theories involving non-metricity and are expected to deepen our understanding of unresolved cosmological problems.

Abstract: Mimetic gravity has emerged as a compelling extension of General Relativity (GR), originally motivated by the attempt to isolate the conformal degree of freedom of the gravitational field. By reparametrizing the physical metric in terms of an auxiliary metric and a scalar field, the theory naturally gives rise to a longitudinal degree of freedom that mimics the behavior of cold dark matter. This review provides a comprehensive survey of the theoretical landscape of mimetic gravity and its multifaceted applications to cosmology and high-energy physics. We begin by examining the original formulation and addressing the fundamental question of its equivalence to GR, highlighting how a singular disformal transformation introduces new physical degrees of freedom. We then explore minimal generalizations that lead to unified cosmological models, including mimetic matter scenarios and extensions into $f(R, φ)$ gravity, which allow for the reconstruction of any desired expansion history. Significant attention is given to the ``limiting curvature'' hypothesis through $f(\Box φ)$ modifications, providing a classical mechanism for resolving cosmological and black hole singularities. We critically assess the challenges facing the theory, specifically the gradient and ghost instabilities identified in cosmological perturbations, and discuss modern resolutions such as ghost-free mimetic massive gravity and covariant formulations of Hořava gravity. Finally, we discuss the role of the mimetic field in the early universe, specifically in the context of asymptotically free gravity and the resolution of the self-reproduction problem in inflation.

Abstract: We investigate the shadow cast by a rotating traversable wormhole in the Teo class endowed with a general redshift function, with particular emphasis on the emergence of cuspy structures. The shadow boundary is the common envelope of two critical orbit families: unstable circular orbits outside the throat and orbits at the throat itself. The formation of cusps, marking the transition between smooth and cuspy shadow boundaries, only becomes possible when the redshift parameter $λ$ is allowed to vary. Moreover, we uncover a universal critical value $λ_c$ that signals the onset of the cusp. A phase diagram characterized by the spin and redshift parameters reveals four distinct morphologies: smooth, cuspy, ears touching, and throat drowning. The morphology of the wormhole shadow may provide observational diagnostics for the different compact objects in future high-resolution imaging observations.

Abstract: After distinguishing the role of classical and quantum inhomogeneities in cosmological backgrounds, we constrain the initial states of the relic gravitons as soon as the different wavelengths of the spectrum cross the comoving Hubble radius, without any reference to earlier timescales. According to this pragmatic perspective the quantum states with finite energy density at the crossing time consistently affect the two-point functions and the related power spectra. An initial state different from the vacuum turns out to be marginally permitted in the low frequency range (associated with the largest observable wavelengths that crossed the comoving Hubble radius) while the intermediate and high frequency domains of the spectrum are populated by the gravitons produced from the vacuum. The non classical correlations are expected to dominate between the kHz and the THz since in this region gravitons are produced quantum mechanically with a negligible contribution from the initial state.

Abstract: We investigated a time-varying cosmological constant model using recent BAO measurements from DESI DR2, combined with Type Ia supernova samples (Pantheon$^{+}$, DES-Dovekie, and Union3) and CMB shift parameters, to constrain the $Λ(t)$CDM model parameters via Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. We find that the interaction term $Q(z)$ shows a sign change for all dataset combinations by crossing $Q(z)=0$, depending on the choice of the dataset: at low redshift $Q(z)<0$, indicating vacuum energy decaying into dark matter, while at high redshift $Q(z)>0$, corresponding to dark matter decaying into vacuum energy. The dynamical system analysis found three critical points, namely $P_1,P_2$, and $P_3$ respectively. The resulting critical points, determined by the underlying cosmological parameters, correspond to distinct epochs in cosmic evolution. Depending on the parameter combinations, these points characterize various cosmological phases, ranging from an accelerated stiff matter-dominated era to late-time accelerated expansion. The stability of each critical point is analyzed using linear stability theory, with the relevant physical constraints on the cosmological parameters duly incorporated throughout the analysis. For each dataset combinations, the $Λ(t)$CDM model predicts that $ω_0 > -1$, showing a preference for dynamical dark energy over the cosmological constant scenario with $ω_0 = -1$. Consequently, the model exhibits a transition phase in the range $N \equiv \log a(t) \approx -0.51$ to $-0.48$ and predicts $q_0$ in the range $-0.54$ to $-0.52$, with the precise transition point depending on the choice of dataset. Finally, the Bayesian evidence shows strong support for the $Λ(t)$CDM model over $Λ$CDM

Abstract: In this paper, we address a foundational challenge in quantum field theory on curved spacetime by developing a consistent framework within loop quantum gravity. We introduce a methodology for defining meaningful superpositions of quantum geometry and matter states. This is achieved by identifying a restricted subspace of the gravitational phase space, which ensures unitary equivalence among Fock representations of a scalar field across different quantum geometries. Within the resulting well-defined state space, we derive weak solutions to the quantum Hamiltonian constraint of general relativity. Furthermore, we generalize the Hartle-Hawking vacuum state to this quantum geometric framework. The resulting state exhibits the inherent entanglement between geometry and matter, which arises from the quantum Hamiltonian constraint of general relativity. This work establishes a principled framework for studying geometry-matter entanglement and offers new insights into the quantum foundations of the black hole information paradox.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel quantum effect wherein particle spectra show extra broadening due to local short-time acceleration (as well as in a deSitter spacetime background). This effect provides a simple interpretation for the acceleration interpolation relation required to modify the kinematics of a test particle in the Modified Inertial interpretation of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). This effect can be regarded as a generalization of the thermal blackbody spectrum generated by the Unruh effect (which arises from long-time uniform acceleration in a flat background) to the scenario of local short-time non-uniform acceleration. This effect offers a unified framework for understanding the accelerated expansion of the universe and the anomalies in galactic rotation curves or radial acceleration. It is worth emphasizing that this modified kinematic interpretation of MOND necessitates a quantum equivalence principle as its physical foundation, that is, extending the equivalence at the level of expectation values (first-order moments) in the classical equivalence principle to the equivalence at the level of second-order moment quantum fluctuations. Therefore, the role of this effect within the frameworks of quantum reference frames and quantum gravity is also discussed to some extent.

Abstract: There has been recent progress in developing well-posed theories of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics and of gravitational effective field theories. These have in common the feature that they introduce unphysical degrees of freedom. We address the problem of how these should be treated. We propose a ''reduction of order'' approach which is applied not at the level of equations of motion but only to initial data. This specifies uniquely the data for the unphysical modes in terms of the data for the physical modes. We argue that the apparent breaking of Lorentz invariance associated with this approach is not a problem provided one restricts to Lorentz frames for which the assumptions of effective field theory are manifestly valid.

Abstract: Gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron star systems can shed light on the currently unknown dense matter equation of state. The equation of state determines a large number of neutron star properties, such as tidal deformability, radius, and quadrupole moment, several of which directly affect the emitted gravitational-wave signals. To reduce the dimensionality when computing gravitational-waves and when interpreting observational data, quasi-universal relations are commonly employed to connect different neutron star properties. However, quasi-universal relations are not exact and their use may introduce uncertainty and bias. We explore the potential biases arising from different quasi-universal relations in the third generation era: (i) the Love-Q relation connecting the spin-induced quadrupole moment and the tidal deformability, (ii) the relation between the fundamental mode frequency and the tidal deformability, and (iii) the binary Love relation. We find that for the quadrupole relation biases are only present for rapidly rotating systems, for the binary-Love relation induces moderate biases only in the next-to-leading-order tidal parameters, which can however propagate into the inferred equation of state at low masses. Regarding fundamental mode frequencies, we find that the employed relation introduces only negligible biases, while waveform systematic effects can become comparatively large. Our results highlight that while quasi-universal relations remain a useful tool within gravitational-wave analyses, careful treatment is needed to avoid biases in equation of state measurements with next-generation detectors.

Abstract: We identify a fundamental tension between the standard formulation of CP violation and diffeomorphism invariance in general relativity. The effective Hamiltonian approach, while phenomenologically successful, relies on a preferred time foliation that is incompatible with general covariance. The CP-violating phases are scalars along the worldline of the decaying parent particle; however, the definition of masses and phases presupposes a local covariant structure, which becomes ill-defined near the origin where curvature is large and metric fluctuations become significant. We propose an information-geometric framework based on relative entropy, exploiting pure quantum states in particle and antiparticle Hilbert spaces. We show how the Sakharov conditions could be reinterpreted in terms of information-geometric quantities, although a fully rigorous phenomenological implementation remains to be developed.

Abstract: We generalize our previous theorem for FLRW spacetime within the framework of generic metric gravity theories. In our earlier work, we demonstrated that, in the absence of matter fields, the field equations of any generic gravity theory reduce to the Einstein field equations with an effective perfect fluid source. In the present study, we extend this analysis by incorporating scalar and vector fields into a generic gravity theory and show that the resulting field equations remain equivalent to the Einstein field equations with a perfect fluid distribution. We further verify our findings by explicitly examining recently developed Einstein-scalar and Einstein-Proca field theories.

Abstract: Golden dark sirens - exceptionally well-localized gravitational-wave (GW) sources without electromagnetic counterparts - offer a powerful route to precision measurements of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, with next-generation (XG) detectors. The statistical promise of this method, however, places stringent demands on waveform accuracy and detector calibration, as even small systematic errors can dominate over statistical uncertainties at high signal-to-noise ratios. We investigate the impact of waveform-modeling systematics on golden dark siren cosmology using a synthetic population of binary black holes consistent with current GW observations and analyzed in the XG-detector era. By comparing state-of-the-art waveform models against numerical-relativity-based reference signals, we quantify modeling inaccuracies from both modeling and data-analysis perspectives and assess how they propagate into biases in luminosity distance, host-galaxy association, and single-event $H_0$ inference. We find that while current waveform models often allow recovery of statistically consistent $H_0$ posteriors, small waveform-induced biases can significantly affect three-dimensional localization and host galaxy ranking, occasionally leading to incorrect redshift assignments. We further derive order-of-magnitude requirements on detector calibration accuracy needed to ensure that calibration systematics remain subdominant for golden dark sirens observed with XG networks. To realize sub-percent $H_0$ measurements with golden dark sirens will require waveform and calibration accuracies that scale as $\mathcal{O}(ρ^{-2})$ with signal-to-noise ratio, motivating sustained advances in waveform modeling, numerical relativity, and detector calibration for the XG era.

Abstract: The article deals with Gödel-like solutions in the context of Galilean gravity, a geometric formulation of non-relativistic gravitation defined on a five-dimensional Galilean manifold. Within this framework, non-relativistic matter fields admit a covariant description, while the physical Newtonian dynamics is recovered through an immersion into the usual $3+1$ spacetime. By adopting a Gödel-like metric ansatz and coupling the gravitational field to a Galilean fluid derived from a variational principle, we obtain a system of highly nonlinear and coupled field equations. Exact solutions are constructed by fixing the matter sector consistently with the field equations. The resulting configurations describe rotating non-relativistic universes and satisfy $D(x)>H(x)$ throughout the entire spatial domain. As a consequence, the associated Killing vector remains spacelike everywhere and no closed timelike curves arise.

Abstract: Dyad is a Python library for studying the dynamics of binary stars considered as gravitational two-body systems. The dynamics of a binary star are determined by its primary and secondary stars' masses along with the secondary star's six orbital elements as defined in a frame comoving with the primary star. In a population of binary stars these eight parameters vary from member to member and can each be treated as a random variable having some probability distribution. Dyad provides a class, dyad.TwoBody, and a module, dyad.stats, for dealing with such a population of binary stars. The dyad.TwoBody class represents a gravitational two-body system while the dyad.stats module provides a suite of classes representing the probability distributions of (1) stellar masses (including those proposed by Kroupa, 2001, and Salpeter, 1955) as well as (2) mass ratios and orbital elements (including those proposed by Duquennoy & Mayor, 1991, and Moe & Di Stefano, 2017).

Abstract: Re-derivation of the sensitivities of all of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) observing modes were required after major updates were introduced to the model atmospheres of the three primary standard stars. The new predicted continuum fluxes were up to 2-3% different from the models used to originally calibrate STIS. This work focuses on the re-derivation of spectral sensitivities for the five STIS low-resolution (L-mode) gratings: G140L, G230L, G230LB, G430L, and G750L, which span wavelengths from the far-ultraviolet through the near infrared. Updated photometric throughput tables were delivered to the Calibration Reference Data System (CRDS) on April 7, 2022 and April 14, 2023, which triggered a recalibration of all historical STIS datasets taken with these modes. The sensitivities derived from each of the standard stars typically agree with one another to better than 1%, though discrepancies as large as 1.5% are found in spectral regions most impacted by hydrogen absorption.

Abstract: Modern studies in astrophysics and cosmology increasingly rely on simulations and cross-survey analyses, yet differences in data generation, instrumentation, calibration, and unmodeled physics introduce distribution mismatches between datasets (``domain shift''). In machine-learning pipelines, this occurs when the joint distribution of inputs and labels differs between the training (source) and application (target) domains, causing source-trained models to underperform on the target. Transfer learning and domain adaptation provide principled ways to mitigate this effect. We study a concrete simulation-to-observation case: semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) to transfer a four-class spectral classifier -- high-redshift quasars, low-redshift quasars, galaxies, and stars -- from J-PAS mock catalogs based on DESI spectra to real J-PAS observations. Our pipeline pretrains on abundant labeled DESI$\rightarrow$J-PAS mocks and adapts to the target domain using a small labeled J-PAS subset. We benchmark SSDA against two baselines: a J-PAS--only supervised model trained with the same target-label budget, and a mocks-only model evaluated on held-out J-PAS data. On this held-out J-PAS data, SSDA achieves a macro-F1 score (balancing precision and recall) of $0.82$ and an overall true positive rate of $0.89$, compared to $0.79/0.85$ for the J-PAS--only baseline and $0.73/0.87$ for the mocks-only model. The gains are driven primarily by improved quasar classification, especially in the high-redshift subclass ($\mathrm{F1}=0.66$ vs.\ $0.55/0.37$), yielding better-calibrated candidate lists for spectroscopic targeting (e.g., WEAVE-QSO) and AGN searches. This study shows how modest target supervision enables robust, data-efficient simulation-to-observation transfer when simulations are plentiful but target labels are scarce.

Abstract: We report a newly identified nonlinearity in H4RG-10 near-infrared detectors operating under moderately elevated-temperature conditions (114 K). This component, that potentially arises from illumination-independent defect currents, introduces additional nonlinearity not captured by conventional correction models. To address this issue, we propose a data-driven nonlinearity correction (NLC) method that models the nonlinear behavior of both the classical response and the defect currents, using dual-illumination measurements and a dark exposure. Applied to H4RG-10 detectors on the PRIME telescope, the method significantly improves signal linearity, especially for pixels with high defect current, while maintaining comparable performance elsewhere. By selecting the optimal correction model per pixel, reliable NLC is achieved across the full array. This study characterizes a nonlinearity intrinsic to H4RG-10 detectors and demonstrates that data-driven post-processing can effectively restore linearity in the presence of large defect currents. Although these effects are unlikely to be significant under nominal operating temperatures, the approach may provide a practical calibration framework for future warm-operation scenarios.

Abstract: We review the algebraic definition of the efficiency of a polarization modulation scheme, which is commonly adopted for solar and stellar spectro-polarimetry applications, and generalize it to allow distinct states of the modulation cycle to have arbitrary throughput and different photon-noise statistics for each state. Such a generalization becomes necessary to model and optimize the polarimetric efficiency of instruments implementing spatial polarization modulation schemes, where different optical paths are assigned to different polarization analysis states, which may be characterized by different throughput values. The proposed algebraic extension also proves essential for introducing a workable concept of the efficiency of a polarization calibration scheme, which can then be used to create a merit function for the optimization of calibration sequences, which take into account the specific characteristics of the polarimetric instrument and of its calibration optics.

Abstract: We expand on our previous study of the impact of atmospheric seeing on polarization cross-talk, and show how the formalism that was developed in that work can be applied to treat the case of spatial modulators of polarization. Beside formally demonstrating how the problem of cross-talk is fully eliminated in such devices, we also gain insight on the meaning of polarimetric noise of temporal modulation schemes in the limit of very high modulation frequency. We also describe the problem of spectrograph instabilities, and how the spectral gradients that are naturally associated with a line spectrum feed into the problem of polarimetric errors induced by mechanical vibrations, thermal drifts, and pointing jitter. Finally, we show how this formalism can be used to estimate the contribution of polarization cross-talk to the errors on the elements of the 4$\times$4 Stokes response matrix, for the purpose of producing realistic error budgets for polarimetric instrumentation.

Abstract: This study demonstrated the pulsar navigation capability of the CubeSat X-ray observatory NinjaSat, which is equipped with two Gas Multiplier Counters (GMCs). The GMCs are sensitive to the 2-50 keV energy band and have an effective area of 16 cm^2 per module at 6 keV. We verified the timing accuracy by observing the Crab Pulsar and confirmed stable timing performance within 100 microseconds. To demonstrate pulsar navigation, we applied a method that optimizes orbital parameters to maximize the significance of the pulsar X-ray pulse profile, known as the Significance Enhancement of Pulse-profile with Orbit-dynamics (SEPO) method. We observed the Crab Pulsar with a total exposure of approximately 100 ks at different epochs and analyzed the data transmitted to the ground. By comparing the optimized orbit with the satellite position derived from Global Positioning System data, we quantitatively evaluated the navigation performance. The results show that the position component along the Crab line of sight was consistently constrained within approximately 40 km, and the three-dimensional position error ranged from 27 to 370 km depending on the observation epoch. These results demonstrate the feasibility of applying a CubeSat-class X-ray observatory to pulsar navigation and provide the first experimental verification that the accuracy of the SEPO method depends on the seasonal geometry between the orbital plane and the pulsar direction.

Abstract: We construct a concept-object knowledge graph from the full astro-ph corpus through July 2025. Using an automated pipeline, we extract named astrophysical objects from OCR-processed papers, resolve them to SIMBAD identifiers, and link them to scientific concepts annotated in the source corpus. We then test whether historical graph structure can forecast new concept-object associations before they appear in print. Because the concepts are derived from clustering and therefore overlap semantically, we apply an inference-time concept-similarity smoothing step uniformly to all methods. Across four temporal cutoffs on a physically meaningful subset of concepts, an implicit-feedback matrix factorization model (alternating least squares, ALS) with smoothing outperforms the strongest neighborhood baseline (KNN using text-embedding concept similarity) by 16.8% on NDCG@100 (0.144 vs 0.123) and 19.8% on Recall@100 (0.175 vs 0.146), and exceeds the best recency heuristic by 96% and 88%, respectively. These results indicate that historical literature encodes predictive structure not captured by global heuristics or local neighborhood voting, suggesting a path toward tools that could help triage follow-up targets for scarce telescope time.

Abstract: The sensitivities of STIS first-order, medium resolution modes were redetermined from on-orbit observations and CALSPEC models (version 11) of the primary white-dwarf spectrophotometric standard stars G191-B2B, GD 71, and GD 153. The sensitivity of an additional configuration was updated by comparing observations of the secondary standard BD +75 325 with the STIS low-resolution spectrum that has been calibrated consistently with the version 11 models. The procedures used to derive the sensitivities and verify the PHOTTAB reference files prior to their activation in CRDS (on May 1, 2025) are described. Results are presented in graphical form in an extensive appendix. Issues and uncertainties are discussed briefly, along with recommendations for future work.
