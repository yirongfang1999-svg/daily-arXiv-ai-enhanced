This yields a simple quadratic relation and a geometric representation in a population-coherence plane, where different routes to purity can be distinguished. In the two-level case we construct explicit families of states with identical spectra and global purity but opposite internal structure, realizing population-dominated and coherence-dominated routes. We then apply this framework to a standard Page-type evaporation model without an explicit Hamiltonian, in which a black hole and its Hawking radiation form a bipartite pure state with varying Hilbert-space dimensions. Using known results for typical reduced states in large dimensions, we analyze the behavior of population and coherence components of purity along the evaporation process. Under the physically motivated requirement that, in this energy-free setting, the radiation populations remain nearly uniform in the chosen basis, we show that the late-time recovery of purity must be coherence-dominated: the global purity of the radiation approaches unity while the population index stays small and the coherence index carries essentially all the purity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In linear $f(Q)$ gravity of the form $f(Q)=\u03b2_1 Q+\u03b2_2$, the theory is dynamically equivalent to General Relativity at the geometric level and modifies stellar structure solely through a uniform rescaling of the matter sector governed by $\u03b2_1$. Consequently, linear $f(Q)$ alone does not introduce new geometric families of stellar solutions or alter classical compactness bounds. To overcome this structural limitation, we incorporate gravitational decoupling within an embedding class-I (Karmarkar) Vaidya-Tikekar configuration in linear $f(Q)$ gravity. While similar VT-based decoupling constructions exist in GR, the present framework introduces a controlled two-parameter deformation characterized by $(\u03b5,\u03b2_1)$: the decoupling parameter $\u03b5$ governs geometric deformation and EOS stiffness, whereas $\u03b2_1$ independently rescales the matter sector without altering the metric structure. This separation permits a direct comparison between GR and linear $f(Q)$ gravity at fixed geometric deformation, thereby isolating pure coupling-driven mass enhancement. We determine the admissible parameter domain from regularity, matching, causality and compactness requirements and derive an analytic compactness bound for the decoupled embedding class-I configuration. The combined action of $\u03b5$ and $\u03b2_1$ enlarges the accessible stellar mass window while preserving physical acceptability, allowing configurations compatible with recent high-mass pulsars and mass-gap candidates without exceeding causal limits.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We find that global brightness measurements using large apertures are generally reliable within $\\sim$0.05 magnitudes across the WFC detectors if exposure backgrounds are above $20e^-/{pixel}$ and sources are brighter than $\\sim300e^-$ in a single exposure.

These systems therefore offer the best laboratories to study the differences between partial and full disruptions. One noteworthy observational difference between the two systems is that all known X-ray bright repeating TDEs show rapid transitions between thermal, non-thermal and completely dim states on timescales much shorter than full (non-repeating) TDEs. We argue this can be simply understood as being due to the reduction in fuel supply available to the disk, and that these systems provide evidence that all tidal disruption events undergo a state transition at Eddington ratios $f_{\\rm edd} = L_{\\rm bol}/L_{\\rm edd} \\sim 0.01$, similar to X-ray binaries. {As part of this calculation we derive a general expression for the time taken for a TDE disk to fall to a given Eddington fraction, which will be of use to both full and partial TDE science.} Perhaps surprisingly, the late-time optical/UV plateau luminosity observed from these systems is largely unaffected by this reduction in fuel supply, provided the outer disk remains in a thermal state for long enough for this emission to be detected. We then show that collisions between the returning stellar remnant and the disk formed from the last passage will produce potentially observable X-ray flares ($L_{\\rm flare} \\simeq 10^{42}$ erg/s), but that they are likely to be very difficult to detect as they are generally short-lived ($t_{\\rm flare} \\simeq 0.1-1$ hr).", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Consequently, pre-training using self-supervised learning (SSL), which offers a scalable route by extracting structure directly from unlabelled images, is becoming attractive for many downstream applications. In this work we consider the use of coupled self-supervised representation learning approaches for radio galaxy morphology pre-training. In order to account for the more nuanced variations in radio galaxy morphology than are typically included in the augmented views of view-based SSL algorithms, we use a pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate views for training a larger view-based self-supervised model. To do this, a $\u03b2$-VAE was trained on the Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) dataset, where moderate regularization ($\u03b2= 2.3$) was found to provide a good balance between reconstruction quality and disentanglement of generative factors such as source multiplicity and lobe asymmetry. An analysis of the $\u03b2$-VAE reveals that Fanaroff-Riley class identity manifests as a continuous transition across the latent space, rather than being associated to a single discrete dimension. $\u03b2$-VAE reconstructions were then incorporated as generative augmentations within a view-based SSL pipeline. Our experiments show that combining these generative views with standard image augmentations improves downstream classification performance, and we present ablation studies clarifying the relative contribution of each augmentation type. These results indicate that generative and contrastive approaches are complementary, and point toward disentanglement-aware self-supervised learning as a promising direction for future radio astronomy surveys.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Part of obtaining that data is often centering objects in the aperture to a higher accuracy than is available from Hubble Space Telescope's (HST's) blind pointing. On HST STIS the sequence of exposures responsible for this centering is the target acquisition or STIS ACQ sequence, and it is most often placed only at the beginning of a visit. Unfortunately, STIS ACQ sequences will fail if the observatory experiences issues locating guide stars in time for the start of the required exposures. If the guide stars are located at a later point in the visit, the remaining science exposures can be taken but the pointing might not be as accurate as is required. This work discusses both the frequency of this issue and the feasibility of placing redundant or \"safety\" STIS ACQ sequences in a multi-orbit visit to regain the desired pointing accuracy in an affected visit. To do so we select a subset of all 113 STIS ACQ sequences from September 2018 to September 2023 which have experienced this issue. We find that this problem occurs in ~5% of the total STIS ACQ sequences taken during that time period, with a recent increase in the rate to ~9% from March to September 2023. Since the observatory goes through periods of better or worse pointing performance, this recent increased failure rate is not guaranteed to continue. For those failed visits which span multiple orbits, ~39% never obtain a lock on the guide stars and thus take no data. Of the multi-orbit visits that do recover the guide stars, the majority (~78%) do so before the beginning of science exposures in the second orbit. We also provide advice for users on how to make a risk assessment based on the analysis presented here.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A sharp qualitative distinction emerges: for Kerr--Newman black holes, the spin-precession frequency generically diverges as the horizon is approached (remaining finite only for the ZAMO family), whereas for Kerr--Newman naked singularities, the precession remains finite throughout the spacetime, with divergences confined to the ring singularity on the equatorial plane. Working with physically admissible stationary observers (including ZAMOs), we first construct the timelike geodesic motion and the fundamental orbital frequencies for equatorial circular orbits. Using these, we analyse the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, the ISCO shift induced by the charge parameter $Q$, and the associated periastron and nodal precession frequencies relevant to quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs).

SiPMs exhibit comparable or even higher photon detection efficiencies (PDEs) than PMTs. The sensitivity of a PMT matches well the spectral shape of Cherenkov radiation from extended air showers. In contrast to a PMT, the sensitivity of a SiPM is shifted toward longer wavelengths, where the intensity of light of night sky (LoNS), considered as unwanted noise, increases significantly. It is obvious that a SiPM with a higher PDE will indeed measure more Cherenkov light than a PMT, but it will also detect significantly higher LoNS noise; the question is which factor will predominate in the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). To compare the performance of a PMT with that of a SiPM, we built SiPM-based modules and installed these and operated in parallel in the imaging camera of the 17 m diameter MAGIC telescope. Our long-term studies show that SiPM, despite their higher PDE, can deliver only a comparable to PMT performance. As already the name SiPM suggests, we use these semiconductor sensors analogously to classical PMTs: We amplify their small signals, digitize, and calibrate the converted amplitudes. Although SiPM is essentially a digital sensor, its common-anode design does not allow one to directly profit from it. Numerous arrays of single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are being developed in various laboratories worldwide.

In this work, we study synthetic gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron star mergers with next-generation detectors, investigating their potential to extract both nuclear physics and dark-matter constraints. We also examine how the potential presence of fermionic, non-interacting dark matter inside neutron stars affects the inference of nuclear empirical parameters. We find that combining observations can tighten constraints on nuclear empirical parameters. However, the inferred values remain sensitive to systematic modeling biases and intrinsic degeneracies among the parameters. Conversely, our analysis reveals that even in the presence of dark matter, it will be unlikely to find decisive evidence for dark matter when analyzing gravitational-wave signals.

Here we develop a conformal formulation of black-hole perturbation theory based on the CEFEs and derive the conformal Teukolsky equation. Starting from a transparent review of Friedrich's regularisation strategy, this work establishes a direct connection between mainstream curvature-based linear perturbation theory and conformal formulations of general relativity. This perspective is timely given the growing relevance of hyperboloidal frameworks in black-hole perturbation theory, where conformal compactification is introduced at the level of an already linearised effective wave equation. Here instead, the conformal factor is a dynamical variable within the field equations. In the non-linear equations there is a coupling between conformal and curvature perturbations; however, when linearised around a Petrov-type D background, the conformal factor decouples from the equations governing the Newman-Penrose components $\u03c6_0$ and $\u03c6_4$ of the rescaled Weyl tensor. The resulting equation preserves the structural form of the classical Teukolsky equation while remaining regular at the conformal boundary. This provides a geometric interpretation of the hyperboloidal master variable and an entry point into the CEFE framework. We further derive the conformal Teukolsky equation for a conformal representation of Kerr spacetime where spatial infinity is realised as a blown-up cylinder.

We further show, in a largely model-independent way, that the contribution from NGC 1068-like sources does not overshoot the observed medium-energy neutrino flux. Finally, we highlight the key role of the Eddington ratio, which can drive substantial variations in the predicted neutrino fluxes of nearby AGNs, and we encourage systematic multimessenger searches for the neutrino-brightest AGNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Hence, incorporating it within the gravity-thermodynamics framework, we result to a modified cosmological scenario with additional terms, which eventually give rise to an effective dark energy sector. We extract analytical expressions for the dark energy density and equation-of-state parameters, and we show that the Universe experiences the usual thermal history, with the sequence of matter and dark-energy eras.

Spherical harmonic expansions must be truncated at finite multipole l_max^rec, often set to l_max^N_pair$\\equiv {\\rm int}\\left[\\sqrt{\\text{N_pair}}-1\\right]$, where N_pair is the number of distinct pulsar pairs in an array. This choice is motivated by the counting argument that cross-correlations provide at most N_pair independent constraints. We obtain the multipole l_max^res corresponding to the maximum informative angular scale of a PTA. It is defined such that expansions to l_max^res (approximately) span the space of \"observable skies\" encoded in the N_pair eigenmaps of the Fisher information matrix, and therefore depends on the array configuration. We explicitly show that GWB power contained in multipoles l$\\gtrsim$l_max^res do not significantly affect analyses that use expansions out to l_max^res, because the PTA response acts as a low-pass filter. In contrast, truncating at l_max^rec< l_max^res leads to leakage of small-scale angular power from l_max^rec<l$\\leq$l_max^res. Even choosing l_max^rec=l_max^res, the standard frequentist estimator of the angular power spectrum C_l remains biased by the modes unobservable by the array. Although we can (partially) debias the standard estimator -- improving its agreement with an injected spectrum -- this reduction in bias comes at the expense of an increase in variance, particularly for poorly constrained modes with l$\\gg$l_eff. We therefore recommend: (i) using l_max^res for PTA analyses involving spherical harmonic expansions, and (ii) using the debiased standard estimator for C_l recovery, but only out to multipoles l<l_eff ($\\ll$l_max^res) corresponding to sufficiently constrained modes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this article, to gain a clearer understanding and offer a new perspective, we study these equations under special assumptions: the manifold $(M,g)$ is harmonic and data is radial.\n  In this setting, the system reduces to a single nonlinear equation and is completely resolved in the standard cases. In particular, on the sphere, our results reveal phenomena that contrast with the well-known achievements on compact manifolds without conformal Killing vector fields, including nonexistence of solutions in the near-CMC regime and instability when the mean curvature is non-constant. By contrast, on Euclidean or hyperbolic manifolds, the equations are always solvable, with all expected properties of solutions satisfied. These findings support the view that, although the conformal method appears to present some drawbacks on compact manifolds, it remains a promising tool for parametrizing solutions to the constraint equations on asymptotically flat and hyperbolic manifolds in arbitrary mean curvature regimes.\n  In this article, we also investigate the sign of mass, showing that the ADM and asymptotically hyperbolic mass can take arbitrary sign when the decay rate of symmetric $(0,2)$-tensor $k$ at infinity is critical.
