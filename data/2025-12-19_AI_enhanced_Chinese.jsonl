This particle production acts as a source of thermal friction on the field that can make it difficult to distinguish whether dark energy is due to a radiating field rolling down a steep potential, a purely self-interacting field moving down a flatter potential, or a cosmological constant. By reducing the acceleration of the scalar field, thermal friction increases the amount of accelerated expansion and can cause a sizable bump in the quintessence equation of state. We take special interest in the case where a steep potential rapidly changes from positive to negative as the field evolves, resulting in the end of cosmic expansion and the beginning of contraction. Even in this case, we find that thermal friction lengthens the period of accelerated expansion and consequently delays the end of cosmic expansion, making it challenging to detect the impending transition to contraction using conventional cosmological tests. However, particle production can also provide alternative avenues for detection by generating a background of thermal dark radiation, partly comprised of neutrinos or other particles, whose energy density exceeds the remnant photon energy density.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The suppressed diffusion can be attributed to self-generated magnetic turbulence, driven -- via the non-resonant streaming instability -- by electron--positron pairs escaping the PWNe. This instability requires a net current, yet the beam of escaping pairs is expected to be charge-neutral. We show that a charge-neutral pair beam propagating through an electron--proton plasma can spontaneously generate a net current. Using fully kinetic two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations with realistic mass ratio, we find that beam electrons get focused into self-generated magnetic filaments produced by the nonlinear evolution of the Weibel instability, while beam positrons remain unconfined. The resulting net (positron) current drives the non-resonant streaming instability, further amplifying the magnetic field. This mechanism provides a pathway for the onset of charge asymmetries in initially charge-neutral pair beams and for the growth of magnetic fluctuations that efficiently scatter the beam particles, with implications for the formation of X-ray filaments and, more broadly, for particle self-confinement in TeV halos around PWNe.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

First, assuming the field to be initially in a zero-mean Gaussian Hadamard state in a globally hyperbolic spacetime, we evaluate the field's two-point function in second-order perturbation theory by techniques of covariant curved spacetime quantum field theory, which allow a full control of the time and space localisation of the interaction, and do not rely on field mode decompositions or non-local particle countings. The detector's two-point function splits into a deterministic and a fluctuating part, and we show that this split is maintained in the back-action.\n  We then specialise to a two-level Unruh-DeWitt detector, prepared in an energy eigenstate, for which the back-action is fully fluctuating. We compute the renormalised stress-energy tensor for a massless scalar field in $(3+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime for a general detector trajectory, using the manifestly causal two-point function. We present explicit analytic and numerical results for an inertial detector and a uniformly linearly accelerated detector, switched on in the asymptotic past. The energy flux into and out of the accelerated detector accounts exactly for the energy gained and lost by the detector in its transitions due to the Unruh effect. The same holds for the outward flux associated with de-excitations of the inertial detector, which has a vanishing excitation rate and no inward flux. A novelty with the accelerated detector is two regions of negative energy density when the detector is initially prepared in its ground state, one near the Rindler horizon that bounds the causal future of the trajectory, the other in the far future of the trajectory.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We investigated the impact of this selection bias on the energy function through simulations and then applied our analysis to the particular case of FRB 20220912A. Our simulations show that, in the sample of bursts observed by the Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), assuming a unimodal intrinsic energy distribution, the band selection effect alone is insufficient to produce a bimodal energy distribution; only the bimodal central frequency distribution can achieve this. The bursts' energy of FRB 20220912A that primarily fell within the observing band showed no significant correlation with the central frequency. In contrast, bursts with higher central frequency tend to exhibit narrower bandwidth and longer duration. The distribution of the intrinsic energy can be modeled as a log-normal distribution with a characteristic energy of $8.13 \\times 10^{37}$ erg, and a power-law function with the index of $1.011 \\pm 0.028$. In contrast to the initial energy function reported by \\cite{2023ApJ...955..142Z}, the low-energy peak vanishes, and the high-energy decline becomes steeper, which implies the low-energy peak is an observational effect.

Using simulated LISA observations containing injected EMRIs and streams of shapelet-based glitches drawn from the LISA Pathfinder catalog, we estimate the glitch-induced parameter biases and uncertainties through a Fisher-matrix-based analysis whose accuracy we verify with Markov-Chain Monte Carlo.

But before we can time them, or VLBI them, we must first find them. Here, we describe the considerations and strategies one needs to account for when planning an all-sky blind pulsar survey using the SKA. Based on our understanding of the pulsar population, the performance of the now-under-construction SKA elements, and practical constraints such as evading radio frequency interference, we project pulsar survey yields using two complementary methods for a number of illustrative survey designs, combining SKA1-Low and SKA1-Mid Bands 1 and 2 in a variety of ways. A composite survey using both Mid and Low is optimal, with Mid Band 2 focused in the plane. We find that, given its much higher effective area and survey speed, the best strategy is to use SKA1-Low to cover as much sky as possible, ideally also overlapping with the areas covered by Mid. In our most realistic scenario, we find that an all-sky blind survey with Phase 1 of the SKA with the AA* array assembly will detect $\\sim10,000$ slow pulsars and $\\sim 800$ millisecond pulsars (MSPs) if SKA1-Mid covers the region within $5\u00b0$ of the plane, while higher latitudes will be covered with SKA1-Low. The yield with AA4 is $\\sim 20\\%$ higher. One could increase these numbers by increasing the range covered by SKA1-Mid Bands 1 and 2, at the cost of a considerably longer survey.

We focus on perturbations of $d$-dimensional Tangherlini black holes and recast the TTM problem as a generalized eigenvalue problem by utilizing the Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates. The results show that TTMs are generically spectrally unstable, with sensitivity increasing for higher overtones, in close analogy with quasinormal modes. A notable exception is a purely imaginary TTM whose pseudospectrum's contours are nearly concentric and whose condition number is orders of magnitude smaller than that of the overtones, indicating enhanced spectral stability.

Pulsar surveys with the SKAO telescopes will greatly increase the known population, adding radio pulsars to every subgroup in the radio-loud neutron star family. These discoveries will not only add to the current understanding of neutron star physics by increasing the sample of sources that can be studied, but will undoubtedly also uncover previously unknown types of sources that will challenge our theories of a wide range of physical phenomena. A broad variety of scientific studies will be made possible by a significantly increased known population of neutron stars, unravelling questions such as: How do isolated pulsars evolve with time; What is the connection between magnetars, high B-field pulsars, and the newly discovered long-period pulsars; How is a pulsar's spin-down related to its radio emission; What is the nuclear equation of state? Increasing the known numbers of pulsars in binary or triple systems may enable both larger numbers and higher precision tests of gravitational theories and general relativity, as well as probing the neutron star mass distribution. The excellent sensitivity of the SKAO telescopes combined with the wide field of view, large numbers of simultaneous tied-array beams that will be searched in real time, wide range of observing frequencies, and the ability to form multiple sub-arrays will make the SKAO an excellent facility to undertake a wide range of neutron star research.

In the case of spatially flat Friedmann universe, adopting this extended relation in the generalized non-linear IS theory, provides new class of analytical solutions in both, the linear, and the non-linear regimes. We also find that, the resulting effective equation of state in the linear regime naturally reproduces the generalized polytropic form which is often introduced phenomenologically in literature. Resulting dynamical implications are investigated and the constraints necessary for ensuring an acceptable evolutionary behavior for the fluid are determined. A detailed dynamical system analysis of the coupled Einstein-Israel-Stewart (EIS) system is also performed.

The second approach, called the local convolutive approach, is based on a more realistic convolutive model that allows simultaneous decontamination and deconvolution of spectra. For each approach, a mixing model was developed that links the observed data to the source spectra. This was done either in the spatial domain for the local instantaneous approach or in the Fourier domain for the local convolutive approach. Four methods were then developed to decontaminate these spectra from the mixtures, exploiting the direct images provided by photometers.

By constructing a unified geometric framework integrating real analysis and covering space theory, we reveal the universal mathematical mechanism behind this phenomenon. We prove that this multivaluedness originates from two non-degenerate critical points in the temperature function $T(r_+)$, where $r_+$ is the horizon radius, which fold the parameter space into a three-sheeted covering structure. As a direct application, we propose that a black hole undergoes a first-order phase transition if and only if its $T(r_+)$ curve has two extrema. Accordingly, we establish a classification scheme, denoted $A1$, $A2$, and $B$ for black holes. This scheme offers a complementary perspective to classifications based on global topological invariants.

To accelerate a confident detection of such a signal and then study gravitational-wave emitting sources, it is necessary to observe a larger number of millisecond pulsars to greater timing precision. The SKAO telescopes, which will be a factor of three to four greater in sensitivity compared to any other southern hemisphere facility, are poised to make such an impact.

However, its interpretation is often ambiguous: statistical noise and analysis choices can bias measurements, making it difficult to distinguish genuine source variability from artifacts. Here we perform a comprehensive suite of simulations to establish a quantitative framework for validating Haar-based MVT measurements. We show that in multi--component light curves, the MVT returns the most statistically significant structure in the interval, which is not necessarily the fastest intrinsic timescale, and can therefore converge to intermediate values. Reliability is found to depend jointly on the MVT value and its signal-to-noise ratio ($\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{MVT}}$), with shorter intrinsic timescales requiring proportionally higher $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{MVT}}$ to be resolved.\n  We use this relation to define an empirical MVT Validation Curve, and provide a practical workflow to classify measurements as robust detections or upper limits.

Comments welcome!", "summary": "The gravitational-wave signal from the neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger GW200105 is consistent with this binary having significant orbital eccentricity close to merger. This raises the question of how an eccentric NSBH might form. Compact object binaries that form via isolated binary star evolution should radiate away any orbital eccentricity long before their gravitational-wave signal enters the sensitive frequency range of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network. Meanwhile, dynamical environments -- which can be conducive to mergers on eccentric orbits -- produce very few NSBHs. We estimate the minimum measurable eccentricity of NSBHs at 10 Hz orbit-averaged gravitational-wave frequency, $e_{\\mathrm{min},10}$, finding that for GW200105, GW200115, and GW230529-like systems, $e_{\\mathrm{min},10}$ is O(0.01). For a GW190814-like unequal-mass binary with significant higher-order mode content, $e_{\\mathrm{min},10}=0.003$; this is an order of magnitude lower than when higher-order modes are not present. For dominant-mode signals from eccentric binaries with $m_2=1.5$ M$_\\odot$ and a range of total masses from $3\\,{\\rm M_\\odot} \\leq M \\leq50\\,\\rm M_\\odot$, we find $0.008\\leq e_{\\mathrm{min},10}\\leq0.022$. The relationship between $M$ and $e_{\\mathrm{min},10}$ is linear when the binaries are non-spinning. When the binaries are maximally spin-precessing, $e_{\\mathrm{min},10}$ decreases as mass ratio becomes more unequal. We estimate the sensitivity of a quasi-circular templated search to a population of NSBHs from field triples, finding that we recover only 27% of our simulated population. Finally, we show that if ~1/3 of present NSBH detections are measurably eccentric, then all of them are consistent with an isolated field triple origin.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our dataset comprises five EOS models representative of a broad range of neutron star properties. The SDL framework is optimised under realistic detection conditions by injecting signals into simulated noise matching the sensitivity curves of ET and NEMO.

The subpulse drift is observed in the QN mode only in the first and last components of the average profile. The normal mode is interrupted by nullings and transitions into the abnormal AB mode. In the AB mode, the structure at the edge of the outer cone is destroyed, the distance between the inner and outer cones is almost doubled, and the distance between the inner cone and the central region is reduced.Analysis of our data has shown that the components of the outer and inner cones of the average profile are formed by an ordinary mode of radio emission (O-mode) and form a single cone radiation of the pulsar.

Multi-messenger observations have so far provided the first evidence for a neutrino source, illustrated by the joint detection of the flaring blazar TXS 0506+056 in highenergy (HE, E > 1 GeV) and very-high-energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV) gamma rays in coincidence with the high-energy neutrino IceCube-170922A, identified by IceCube. Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), namely FACT, H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS, continue to conduct extensive neutrino target-of-opportunity follow-up programs. These programs have two components: followup observations of single astrophysical neutrino candidate events (such as IceCube-170922A), and observation of known gamma-ray sources after the identification of a cluster of neutrino events by IceCube. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of follow-up observations of high-energy neutrino events observed by the four IACTs between September 2017 (after the IceCube-170922A event) and January 2021. Our study found no associations between gamma-ray sources and the observed neutrino events. We provide a detailed overview of each neutrino event and its potential counterparts. Furthermore, a joint analysis of all IACT data is included, yielding combined upper limits on the VHE gamma-ray flux.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Notably, we discovered an unexpected high-state X-ray plateau phase following the peak until the present time. Along with its reported prolonged rise lasting at least 550 days, these unique characteristics are consistent with the scenario of a TDE caused by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) with a mass of approximately $(1-6) \\times 10^5$ solar masses. Furthermore, scaling relations derived from the host-galaxy properties indicated a similar BH mass in concert.

During such events, the radiative energy of the star is primarily concentrated in the optical and X-ray bands, with the X-ray flux potentially increasing by tens or even hundreds of times. Einstein Probe (EP) detected a new X-ray transient EP J2322.1-0301 on 27 September 2024. Its spatial localization shows a high positional coincidence with the nearby high proper motion K-type star PM J23221-0301. Follow-up X-ray observations confirmed the flux enhancement of the source, while optical spectroscopic monitoring revealed time-variable features, particularly the disappearance of the H-alpha emission line. This X-ray flare is consistent with a characteristic fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED) light curve, with a rise timescale of 1.4 ks, a decay timescale of 5.7 ks, and a total duration of about 7.1 ks. The peak luminosity in the 0.5-4.0 keV energy band reached about 1.3 x 10^31 erg s^-1, with a total energy release of about 9.1 x 10^34 erg, consistent with the empirical energy correlations observed in magnetic-reconnection-driven stellar flares, as inferred from the multitemperature plasma structure and H-alpha-X-ray energy correlation.

Motivated by an innovative candidate selection method, we aim at detecting millisecond pulsars associated with the Galactic Center Excess by carrying deep radio pulsation searches towards promising candidates detected in the inner Galaxy, in X rays by Chandra, and in radio or gamma rays by the Very Large Array or Fermi. We conducted deep radio observation and follow-up campaigns with MeerKAT, the Murriyang and the Green Bank telescopes towards 9 X-ray candidate sources.

However, radio surveys searching for pulsations have not yet revealed bulge millisecond pulsars. Identifying promising bulge millisecond pulsar candidates is key to motivating pointed radio pulsation searches. Candidates are often selected among steep-spectrum or polarized radio sources, but multiwavelength information can also be exploited: The aim of this work is to pinpoint strong candidates among the yet unidentified X-ray sources. We investigated the multiwavelength counterparts of sources detected by the Chandra X-ray observatory that have spectral properties expected for millisecond pulsars in the Galactic bulge. We considered that ultraviolet, optical, and strong infrared counterparts indicate that an X-ray source is not a bulge pulsar, while a radio or a faint infrared counterpart makes it a promising candidate. We identify a large population of more than a thousand X-ray sources without optical, ultraviolet, or strong infrared counterparts. Among them, five are seen for the first time in unpublished radio imaging data from the Very Large Array. We provide the list of promising candidates, for most of which follow-up pulsation searches are ongoing.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

(..) We focused our search on gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), X-ray flashes (XRFs), X-ray flares from high-mass X-ray binaries and stellar flares, while Type-I and II X-ray bursts from Galactic neutron stars were excluded. 149 such fast transient events were detected. 63 of these are new to the literature. 38 flares are identified with 22 nearby stars. Three stars have never been seen flaring before in X-rays or optical (NLTT 51688, GR Dra and UCAC4 255-003783). We find that the MeV transient GRO J1753+57 is most likely the same object as GR Dra rather than an AGN as previously thought. Eleven flares were detected from known high-mass X-ray binaries with irregular wind accretion (four of which are of the subclass of supergiant fast X-ray transients). 100 GRBs were identified of which 24 have not been published before. We classify 37% of the X-ray detected GRBs as XRFs with relatively large X-ray to gamma-ray flux ratio, gamma-rays being measured with the BeppoSAX Gamma Ray Burst Monitor. The duration/spectral hardness distribution of all FXTs is bimodal, separating the group roughly in transients shorter and longer than 1 ksec and with relatively hard and soft spectra, respectively. We identify the 'short' FXTs as GRBs and XRFs and the `long' FXTs as flares from nearby late-type stars and X-ray binaries. The BeppoSAX-WFC FXT sample is found to be consistent with the one observed by Einstein Probe, when the sensitivity of the two instruments is taken into account.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
