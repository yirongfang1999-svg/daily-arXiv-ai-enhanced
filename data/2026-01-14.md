Abstract: We confront the ghost-free non-local $F(R)$ gravity theories with the latest Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) constraints on the spectral index of the scalar perturbations and the updated constraints of Planck/BICEP on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. After reviewing how the ghost-free non-local version of $F(R)$ gravity can be obtained, we show that the de Sitter solution can be obtained in this framework. Also, we show that the resulting theory can be cast in terms of an $F(R,φ)$ theory of gravity. We analyze two models of non-local $F(R)$ gravity, one power-law and the $R^2$ model, and we show that both models can be compatible with the ACT and updated Planck/BICEP constraints.

Abstract: We formulate a scalar realization of Sciama's Machian programme within the general Bergmann-Wagoner class of scalar--tensor gravity. Starting from a universally conformally coupled matter sector, we rewrite the field equations in terms of the invariant set $\{{\cal I}_1,{\cal I}_2,{\cal I}_3,\hat g_{μν}\}$, so that Machian requirements can be stated independently of conformal frame. Sciama's causal postulate is implemented not by modifying the local dynamics, but as a selection rule on the solution space of the invariant scalar equation: the admissible configuration is the retarded response to the matter distribution in the causal past, with any source-free contribution removed. In a spatially flat FLRW universe, and in the light, slowly varying regime, the prescription reduces to an explicit temporal kernel that links the background scalar evolution to the matter content within the Hubble region, reproducing the expected Machian scaling in an expanding background. Universal coupling to a single physical metric implies that structureless test bodies share the same acceleration in a given external configuration, so that the Eötvs parameter vanishes at leading order. Nonuniversal effects can arise only when gravitational binding energy contributes appreciably to the total mass, as in strongly self-gravitating objects. Thus, the theory implements a causal Machian determination of the cosmological inertial scale while remaining consistent with standard weak-field tests.

Abstract: Repeated black-hole mergers in dense stellar clusters are a plausible mechanism to populate the predicted gap in black hole masses due to the pair-instability process. These hierarchical mergers carry distinct spin and tilt features relative to first-generation black holes, for which previous studies have found evidence at a population level by interpreting features in the effective inspiral spin domain. We introduce an astrophysically-motivated model in the joint space of effective inspiral and precessing spins, which captures the dominant spin dynamics expected for hierarchical mergers. We find decisive evidence both for a population transition above $\sim 45M_\odot$, consistent with the anticipated onset of the pair-instability gap, as well as a peak at $\sim 15 M_\odot$, which we interpret as the global peak in the hierarchical merger rate. The existence of low- and high-mass subpopulations of higher-generation black holes suggests the contribution of both near-solar-metallicity and metal-poor star clusters to the hierarchical merger population. Our results reinforce the growing evidence for detailed, mass-dependent substructure in the spin distribution of the binary black hole population.

Abstract: We investigate the behavior of curvature invariants for a large ensemble of neutron stars built with equations of state (EOSs) that satisfy constraints from nuclear theory and perturbative QCD, as well as measurements of neutron-star masses, radii, and gravitational waves from binary neutron-star mergers. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals that stars with negative Ricci scalar $\mathcal{R}$ are rather common and about $\sim 50\%$ of our EOSs produce one or more stars with Ricci curvature that is negative somewhere inside the star. The negative curvature is found mostly but not exclusively at the highest densities and pressures, and predominantly for stiff EOSs and for the most compact and most massive stars. Furthermore, we improve the quasi-universal relation between the stellar gravitational mass $M$ and the baryonic mass $M_\mathrm{b}$, which allows us to express analytically one in terms of the other with a maximum variance of only $\sim 3\%$. Finally, using the relation between the Ricci scalar and the trace anomaly $Δ$, we determine the conditions under which $Δ$ vanishes or becomes negative in neutron stars.

Abstract: In this work, the Darmois-Israel junction formalism is extended to the case of discontinuous metrics within the framework of Colombeau algebras of generalized functions. This formulation provides a mathematically consistent treatment of nonlinear operations involving singular quantities, such as products and derivatives of distributions. By relaxing the usual continuity condition on the metric, the generalized junction conditions naturally include higher-order singular terms in the curvature and in the surface energy-momentum tensor. These additional contributions represent new geometric degrees of freedom associated with genuine discontinuities in the space-time geometry. The resulting formalism recovers the traditional Darmois-Israel conditions as a limiting case, while offering a coherent extension applicable to geometric boundaries and abrupt transitions in space-time.

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the possibility that the large-scale magnetic fields observed in galaxies, of the order of microgauss, arise naturally from a complex Scalar Field Dark Matter (SFDM) halo charged under a local $U(1)$ symmetry. Extending our previous work, where multistate SFDM solutions were shown to form ``gravitational atoms'' capable of explaining the anisotropic distribution of satellite galaxies (VPOS), we analyze here the coupled dynamics of the scalar and a gauge field at the perturbative level. By solving the perturbed Klein-Gordon and gauge-field equations, we find the temporal evolution and show that the spatial structure of the induced electromagnetic fields is governed by the same spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonics that characterize the ground and excited states of the multi-state SFDM halo. Remarkably, the presence of the gauge field does not modify the dark-matter density distribution, which preserves the multi-state configuration previously obtained. Our results demonstrate that a charged multi-state SFDM halo can generate coherent, large-scale magnetic fields whose morphology is determined by the excited modes of the scalar field, providing a unified framework in which both galactic magnetic fields and VPOS-like structures originate from the underlying quantum nature of dark matter.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum structure of black hole interiors in Horava-Lifshitz gravity by analyzing the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in minisuperspace. Focusing on the ultraviolet regime, where higher-order spatial curvature terms dominate, we derive analytical solutions in this UV limit for both the original Horava-Lifshitz action and its analytically continued counterpart. We study their behavior near the event horizon and the classical singularity, with particular attention to the interpretation of the wave function in terms of the annihilation-to-nothing scenario proposed in general relativity. In this paper, we have considered cases in which the two-dimensional spatial section is spherical, planar, or hyperbolic, as well as models with positive, negative, or vanishing cosmological constant. In all cases, we find that the terms dominating in the ultraviolet regime, together with the effects of the running scaling parameter, act to suppress the annihilation-to-nothing behavior. These results suggest that, at least within the range explored in this study, the characteristic annihilation-to-nothing behavior does not appear in the ultraviolet regime of Horava-Lifshitz gravity, and provide a new perspective on the understanding of singularity resolution in quantum gravity.

Abstract: We study a six-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory with spacetime topology $M_4 \times S^2$ and analyze the gauge sector arising from dimensional reduction. Using normalized Killing vectors on $S^2$, we explicitly construct the reduced Yang-Mills action and determine the corresponding gauge kinetic matrix. Despite the $SO(3)$ isometry of $S^2$, we show that only two physical gauge fields propagate in four dimensions. The gauge kinetic matrix therefore has rank two and possesses a single zero eigenvalue. We demonstrate that this degeneracy is a direct consequence of the coset structure $S^2 \simeq SO(3)/SO(2)$ and reflects a non-dynamical gauge direction rather than an inconsistency of the reduction. Our results clarify the geometric origin of gauge degrees of freedom in Kaluza-Klein reductions on coset spaces.

Abstract: Geometry is wavy: even at the purely geometric level (no particular theory chosen), curvature satisfies a covariant quasilinear wave equation. In Riemannian geometry equipped with the Levi-Civita connection, the Riemann curvature tensor obeys a wave equation of the schematic form \[ \Box Riem=\mathcal{Q}(Riem,Riem), \] where $\mathcal{Q}(Riem,Riem)$ denotes the terms quadratic in the curvature arising from the Bianchi identities. In this work, we generalize this curvature wave equation to spacetimes endowed with a generic affine connection possessing torsion and nonmetricity. Working within the metric-affine framework, we derive the corresponding wave equation for the Riemann tensor and analyze its structure in several geometrically and physically distinguished settings, including Einstein spaces, teleparallel gravity, and Einstein-Cartan theory.

Abstract: We construct a novel exact solution of the Einstein-scalar-Maxwell equations describing a dynamical black hole immersed in an external, time-dependent electromagnetic field. Motivated by the need for more realistic analytical black hole models, our construction incorporates two key ingredients often neglected in exact solutions: a fully dynamical cosmological background and the non-perturbative backreaction of external electromagnetic fields. The compact object is obtained by dressing a Schwarzschild black hole with a radially and temporally dependent scalar field, yielding a time-dependent generalization of the Fisher-Janis-Newman-Winicour solution within the Fonarev framework. The external electromagnetic field is generated via a Lie point symmetry of the Einstein-scalar-Maxwell system, which exports the effect of a Harrison transformation to dynamical settings provided a spacelike Killing vector is present. The resulting spacetime combines a spherically symmetric dynamical horizon with an axisymmetric electromagnetic field and exhibits a rich asymptotic structure mixing Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker and Levi-Civita geometries. We show that the time dependence of the configuration plays a crucial role in potentially cloaking curvature singularities, which would otherwise be generically naked in the stationary limit. We analyze the geometric and physical properties of the solution, including its asymptotic behavior, algebraic classification, and the structure of trapped surfaces defining the dynamical horizon. Possible implications for primordial black holes and some astrophysical applications, as well as extensions to higher dimensions, are also discussed.

Abstract: As is well known, near-horizon (equivalently high acceleration) observers in spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes have a particularly simple form of the quasi-local energy. Using this energy and indistinguishable area quanta satisfying quantum statistics a statistical mechanical description of the Schwarzschild black hole geometry for uniformly accelerating observers is developed. The resulting model has several phases including one with highly excited states, Bose-Einstein condensates, condensates distinct from the usual Bose gas, and degenerate Fermi gases. In the large area limit, relevant for comparison to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, the new condensed state is favored over Bose-Einstein condensation and the degenerate Fermi gas. The entropies of the phases, and the entropy of mixing, are computed. The resulting low-entropic condensed state, where the quanta are essentially all in the lowest Bose energy state, provides the framework for the quantization of near-horizon geometric fluctuations, which is explored in a companion paper.

Abstract: Black hole entropy is identified with the counting of the dynamical degrees of freedom of trapped gravitational modes continually sourced by the Hawking-Unruh process. In the context of linear perturbations of Schwarzschild spacetime the density of states is derived from the orthogonality of states in the solution space of the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equation. The otherwise divergent energy and entropy is cutoff by the Planck scale closest approach of constantly accelerating observers near the horizon. The thermal distribution of the trapped modes, which represent shape fluctuations in the near horizon geometry, store a significant fraction of the spacetime mass as observed from far away. Unlike quasi-normal modes the modes are not directly observable outside of $\sim 3 M$ but, being external to the horizon, they affect the propagation of null rays near the black hole. The characteristic frequencies, around 100 Hz for solar mass black holes, are discussed in relation to possible observations.

Abstract: Rapidly rotating, strongly magnetized neutron stars (``millisecond proto-magnetars'') formed in stellar core-collapse, neutron star mergers, and white dwarf accretion-induced collapse have long been proposed as central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) and accompanying supernovae/kilonovae. However, during the first few seconds after birth, neutrino heating drives baryon-rich winds from the neutron star surface, potentially limiting the magnetization and achievable Lorentz factors of the outflow and casting doubt on whether proto-magnetars can launch ultra-relativistic jets at early times, as needed to power short-duration GRB. We present 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of neutrino-heated proto-magnetar winds that incorporate M0 neutrino transport. While the global wind properties broadly agree with previous analytic estimates calibrated to one-dimensional models, our simulations reveal essential multidimensional effects. For rapidly rotating models with spin periods P = 1 ms, centrifugal forces strongly enhance mass loss near the rotational equator, producing a dense, sub-relativistic outflow ( ~0.1c). This equatorial wind naturally confines and collimates less baryon-loaded outflows emerging from higher latitudes, leading to the formation of a structured bipolar jet with a peak magnetization up to ~ 30-100 along the pole, sufficient to reach bulk Lorentz factors ~ 100 on larger scales. The resulting angular stratification of the outflow energy into ultra-relativistic polar and sub-relativistic equatorial components is broadly consistent with the observed partition between beaming-corrected GRB energies and supernova/kilonova ejecta. Our results demonstrate that millisecond proto-magnetars can launch relativistic jets within seconds of formation and highlight their potential role in powering the diverse electromagnetic counterparts of compact-object explosions.

Abstract: The 1-100 pc region embedding long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lGRBs) has been hitherto unexplored, as extremely high ionisation by the GRB prevents application of optical absorption spectroscopy on such distances. We show that the GRB ionising flux imprints a unique time- and spatially-dependent ionisation structure on the gas, that can be probed by X-ray absorption. Application of this model to a selected sample of 7 bright GRB X-ray afterglow spectra observed by \textit{XMM-Newton} EPIC-pn enables an independent, quantitative estimation of the density (log(n) $\sim$ 2-4) and distances (5-100 pc) of the ionized absorber directly from the GRB X-ray spectrum, thereby allowing us to locate the absorbing medium of this representative sample of long GRBs in the region of the density-size diagram populated by star-forming regions versus other gravitationally bound objects in the Universe.

Abstract: We present the distribution of the intrinsic duration of gamma-ray bursts' prompt emission. This expands upon the analysis of Bromberg et al., 2012 and Bromberg et al. 2013 who showed evidence for collapsar progenitors based on the presence of a plateau in the distribution of $T_{90}$, the duration over which 90 % of the prompt emission is observed for any given detector. We confirm the presence of this plateau in the distribution of duration corrected for cosmological time dilation (what we call intrinsic duration, $T_{int}$), but shifted to smaller timescales by a factor of $1/(1+z_{\rm av}) \sim 1/3$, where $z_{\rm av}$ is the average GRB redshift. More significantly, we show this plateau is only present in the sample of GRBs with redshifts greater than $(1+z) \sim 2$, and does not appear in the duration distribution of lower redshift GRBs. This result aligns with suggestions that the low redshift population of GRBs has a significant contribution from non-collapsar progenitors (while the high redshift sample is dominated by collapsars). We also show the difference in this distribution between spectrally hard and soft GRBs, confirming that a plateau is only present for the soft subset of GRBs. However, when we separate the soft GRBs into low and high redshift subsets, we find that only the high redshift soft GRBs show evidence of a plateau, while the low-redshift soft GRBs do not. This suggests there exists a significant subset of spectrally soft non-collapsar progenitors at low redshift. Finally, we use the end time of the plateau to constrain the GRB progenitor density profile and radius, and show the maximum size of a collapsar is a few tenths of a solar radius.

Abstract: Recent observations of galaxies continue to reveal new ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), increasing their known population and improving the statistics needed to understand their nature. We study the ULX populations of NGC 4631 and NGC 1097 using archival Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Swift/XRT observations to identify new ULXs and investigate their X-ray and optical properties. We analyzed X-ray data spanning 2000-2025. Spectral fitting was performed for sources with sufficient counts using absorbed power-law and diskbb models. Variability analyses, including hardness-intensity diagrams and light curves, were used to assess short- and long-term variability. Optical color-magnitude diagrams and near-infrared (NIR) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) were employed to identify possible donor stars. In NGC 4631, we identified two new transient ULXs, X-6 and X-7, with X-ray count rates varying by more than an order of magnitude. The LX-T^4 relation from diskbb fits provides strong evidence that NGC 4631 X-6 is powered by a stellar-mass black hole accreting via a standard disk. The optical sources within the X-ray error circles of X-6 and X-7 are candidate counterparts, suggesting these systems are candidate HMXBs. In NGC 1097, we discovered a new transient ULX, ULX-3, showing X-ray luminosity variations by a factor of about 30 and evidence for spectral state transitions, consistent with either a stellar-mass black hole or a neutron star. We identified a unique optical and NIR counterpart. While the optical emission is variable, the NIR emission is stable. The NIR SED is consistent with a blackbody temperature of about 3300 K, compatible with a red supergiant donor with a radius of about 200 solar radii.

Abstract: On the framework of relativistic force-free magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, we explore the fundamental properties of strong and weak turbulent cascades using high-resolution numerical simulations in the presence of a uniform background magnetic field. We find that (1) power spectra and scale-dependent anisotropies both for the strong and weak turbulence resemble those observed in the non-relativistic MHD turbulence; (2) intermittency of magnetic fields in strong turbulence is stronger than that in the weak one; (3) generated Alfvén modes show similar energy spectra and scale-dependent anisotropies to those of non-relativistic case; (4) generated fast modes present a power spectrum similar to that of Alfvén modes, with a strong (for strong turbulence) or weak (for weak turbulence) scale-dependent anisotropy, which are significantly different from non-relativistic turbulence; and (5) applications of our numerical results to neutron star magnetospheres show that the strong (or moderately weak) turbulent cascade can explain the X-ray radiation of the Vela pulsar. Our study is of great significance for understanding energy transfer, magnetic field evolution, and particle acceleration mechanisms in extreme astrophysical environments.

Abstract: The Andes Large area PArticle detector for Cosmic ray and Astronomy (ALPACA) is a new air-shower array experiment under construction in the Bolivian Andes, and its prototype ALPAQUITA surface array has been operating since 2023 April. In addition to the traditional $\ge$3-hit or $\ge$4-hit coincidences to trigger recording air-shower events, ALPAQUITA records the counting rates of the $\ge$1-hit and $\ge$2-hit events (Any1 and Any2, respectively). We report a successful detection of a Forbush decrease occurred on 2024 May 10 caused by a passage of an interplanetary shock formed ahead of the Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection. The amplitude detected in the Any1 rate is 4.26$\pm$0.33% at the median primary rigidity of 76GV which is consistent with the observations with the worldwide neutron monitor and muon detector networks. Under the assumption of a power-law rigidity spectrum, we renormalized the errors of the observed amplitude ($A_{obs}$) and fitted them as a function of the median primary rigidity ($R_{m}$) of each detector and observational method. The result $A_{obs} = (10.9\% \pm 0.9\%) \times (R_{m}/10\,GV)^{-0.55 \pm 0.07}$ exhibits a hard nature of this event. Our non-detection in the Any2 rate decrease constrains the amplitude with a 2$σ$ upper limit to be 0.95% at 960GV. This marginally suggests an existence of a spectral softening between 100GV and 1000GV as also suggested by the Misato underground muon detector at 145GV. Although a strong geomagnetic storm was observed during this period, we conclude it does not impact our results. Our novel technique realizes a unique coverage to study the behavior of the Forbush decreases at the highest rigidity.

Abstract: In this {\it Letter}, we present a compelling and robust argument for the roles of neutrino fast flavor conversion (FFC) in the explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernova (CCSN), combining the {\it multi-angle} FFC subgrid model rooted in quantum kinetic theory with the multi-dimensional four-species Boltzmann neutrino radiation hydrodynamics. Employing various progenitor masses and the nuclear equations of states, we find that the effect of FFC on CCSN explosion is bifurcated depending on the progenitors. For the lowest-mass progenitor, FFC facilitates the shock revival and enhances the explosion energy, whereas for higher-mass progenitors its impact is inhibitory. We identify the mass accretion rate as the key determinant governing this bifurcation. When the mass accretion rate is low (high), the contribution of FFC to neutrino heating becomes positive (negative), because the heating efficiency enhancement via FFC-driven spectral hardening of electron-type neutrinos dominates over (is outweighed by) the concurrent reduction in neutrino luminosity. Our results further highlight the limitations of approximate neutrino transport, and demonstrate that a multi-angle treatment is essential for accurately capturing FFC effects; otherwise, FFCs are missed and even generated spuriously.

Abstract: The formation channels of binary black hole (BBH) mergers detected by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) network remain uncertain. While BBH mergers occurring inside active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks may interact with surrounding gas and generate observable optical flares. We test this scenario by quantifying the spatial and temporal correlation between BBH events in GWTC-4.0 and AGN flares identified from six years of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) DR23 data. Using 80 BBH mergers selected for adequate localization, redshift reach, observing-epoch overlap, and ZTF sky coverage, we construct a likelihood for the flare-associated fraction, $f_{\rm flare}$, that combines each event's 3D localization with a locally estimated flare number density derived from a 3D Voronoi tessellation, while explicitly accounting for survey boundaries and incomplete catalog coverage. Adopting a 200-day post-merger time window for potential counterparts, we infer $f_{\rm flare} = 0.07_{-0.05}^{+0.25}$ (90\% confidence level). This non-zero maximum-likelihood value is driven primarily by GW190412, for which a single flare candidate (J143041.67+355703.8) is consistent in both time and spatial position. Excluding GW190412 yields results consistent with no association and an upper limit of $f_{\rm flare} < 0.17$ at 90\% confidence level. The intrinsic properties of GW190412 and the characteristics of the candidate host AGN are broadly consistent with theoretical expectations for the AGN-disk formation channel, motivating continued, targeted electromagnetic follow-up of well-localized and highly asymmetric BBH mergers in current and upcoming time-domain surveys.

Abstract: Aims. The blazars Mrk 421 and Mrk 501 have shown multiwavelength variability on all observed timescales, and have been well studied at high energies on short timescales. We aim to characterise the long-term temporal behaviour of these blazars at synchrotron energies, namely optical, UV, and X-ray, in order to assess current models of these objects and their processes. Methods. Amongst the longest light curves ever studied for these sources, we investigated 20 years of data (2005-2025) from the Swift-UVOT and Swift-XRT telescopes. We examined spectral models, fractional variabilities, flux distributions, and X-ray photon index vs flux relations, as well as carrying out in-depth time series analysis using structure functions, Lomb-Scargle periodograms, and discrete correlation functions. Results. Mrk 421 and Mrk 501 both showed intriguing variability in all studied wavelengths; this variability has been found to be energy dependent, as has the trend of lognormality in flux distributions. X-ray photon indices fluctuated greatly throughout the entire period, showing an overall harder-when-brighter trend. Hints of a quasi-periodicity have been found in the X-ray of Mrk 501 (host frame time scale $\sim390$ days, >3$σ$) but not in the UV or X-ray of Mrk 421, or in the UV of Mrk 501. No correlation at any time lag was found between the optical/UV and X-ray bands in either source.

Abstract: PSR J1455$-$3330 is a $\sim$7.98 ms pulsar in a $\sim$76.17 day nearly circular orbit with a white dwarf companion. In this work, we combine the available Lovell, Nançay decimetric Radio Telescope, Green Bank, and MeerKAT pulsar timing data spanning $\sim$ 30 years to measure the kinematic and relativistic effects of PSR J1455$-$3330 to constrain its 3D orbital geometry and component masses. We detect a relativistic Shapiro delay signal. We measure a significant orthometric amplitude $h_3 = 0.307^{+0.022}_{-0.026}$ $μ$s and an orthometric ratio $ς= 0.551^{+0.057}_{-0.054}$. We measure the change in projected semi-major axis $\dot{x} = -202.1^{+2.5}_{-2.7} \times10^{-16} \, \rm s\,s^{-1}$ with high significance, parallax, $\varpi$ = 1.11(6) mas, parallax derived distance 0.90(5) kpc, and a precise total proper motion magnitude of 12.432(2) mas yr$^{-1}$. A self-consistent analysis of all kinematic and relativistic effects, assuming general relativity, yields two solutions: (1) a pulsar mass $M_{\rm p} = 1.39^{+0.38}_{-0.18}\, \rm M_{\odot}$, a companion mass $M_{\rm c} = 0.293^{+0.056}_{-0.026}$ $\rm M_{\odot}$, an orbital inclination, $i = 63(2)^{\circ}$, and longitude of the ascending node, $Ω= 212(12)^{\circ}$ or (2) a pulsar mass $M_{\rm p} = 1.53^{+1.10}_{-0.22} \, \rm M_{\odot}$, a companion mass $M_{\rm c} = 0.309^{+0.163}_{-0.026}\, \rm M_{\odot}$, an orbital inclination, $i = 123(4)^{\circ}$, and longitude of the ascending node, $Ω= 334(12)^{\circ}$. All uncertainties represent the 68.27$\%$ credibility region. These results strongly favour a helium-dominated white dwarf companion.

Abstract: Relativistic jets launched in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are widely accepted as the engines powering most of the population of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Understanding their structure and dynamics-particularly during and after breakout from the merger ejecta-is crucial for interpreting GRB afterglows, especially for off-axis observers. Traditional models often assume simple angular or radial jet profiles, potentially missing key features emerging for jets piercing through realistic environments. This work aims to investigate the formation and evolution of the jet structure as it propagates through a non-homogeneous, anisotropic BNS merger environment. We focus on how the interaction with the ambient medium shapes the jet's angular and velocity distributions and assess the impact of this realistic structure on the resulting afterglow light curves. We perform a series of 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of jets launched in post-merger environments, exploring different injection conditions. Simulations are evolved to late times, approaching the ballistic regime, where further dynamical evolution becomes negligible. From the resulting outflows, we extract energy and velocity profiles and compute multi-wavelength afterglow light curves using a semi-analytic model that includes radial stratification and the full 3D jet geometry. More energetic or earlier-launched jets drill more efficiently through the ejecta, but all develop asymmetries that leave clear imprints in the off-axis afterglow light curves. All models exhibit a complex multi-shock breakout structure responsible for an early, dimmer peak in the afterglow. Despite structural differences, all simulated jets are consistent with the observational data of the multi-messenger BNS merger event GW170817.

Abstract: We present a quantitative symmetry-identification pipeline for astrophysical images based on Transformation Information (TI), an information measure of self-similarity under geometric transformations. TI is expressed as a Kullback-Leibler (cross-entropy) divergence between an image and its rotated or reflected counterpart on the overlapping domain. By scanning rotation angles and reflection axes, we obtain TI curves whose local minima identify symmetry operations. We validate the method on a wind-rose pattern and then apply it to planetary nebulae, where the recovered axes trace bipolar and multipolar lobes consistent with morphology-based classifications. Applying TI to supernova remnants yields estimate axes associated with protrusions, rims, and substructure. To emphasize global morphology, we introduce a thresholded two-level variant that compares binary silhouettes and can reveal outline-driven symmetries. Finally, we quantify symmetry using a minima prominence-to-width score and show that this compact descriptor separates Type Ia and core-collapse remnants into distinct populations for an X-ray sample. TI provides a non-parametric, reproducible framework for symmetry identification, classification and population studies.

Abstract: Mapping the boundary of an extended source is a key step in the study of its morphology. The background contamination and statistical fluctuations of typical astronomical images make this a challenging statistical task, particularly for X-ray images with low surface brightness. We develop a three-step Bayesian procedure to identify the boundaries of irregularly shaped sources. We first apply a Bayesian multiscale reconstruction algorithm known as LIRA to obtain posterior pixelwise probability distributions of the source intensity that properly account for known structures, astrophysical background, and the effect of the telescope point spread function. Next, we adopt an Ising model to group pixels with similar intensities into cohesive regions corresponding to background and source. Finally, the boundary is derived on the basis of the most likely aggregation of pixels into the source region. Because the overall model combines LIRA and the Ising model, we call it LIRA-Ising. We verify the proposed method using a set of simulation studies. We then apply it to the Chandra X-ray Observatory images of two high redshift quasars, PKS J1421-0643 and 0730+257, to determine the extent and morphology of X-ray jets. Our method shows a uniform X-ray surface brightness of PKS J1421-0643 jet, and identifies knotty structure in the X-ray jet of 0730+257.

Abstract: Radio Frequency Interference (RFI), the presence of artificial and/or terrestrial signals in astronomical data, poses a great challenge to the search for pulsars and radio transients, such as Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs) and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), by obscuring or distorting the signal of interest and resulting in large numbers of erroneous detections. RFI mitigation algorithms aim to remove this interference and improve the chance of detection of transients, but with the growing number of techniques, selecting the most appropriate method for a given survey can be problematic. The choice of method is particularly important in real-time searches planned for next-generation telescopes such as those of the SKAO, where there is no possibility to reprocess the data. In this paper, we explore the algorithm selection problem by injecting pulses into data which simulates several RFI environments. A set of these files is then cleaned using RFI mitigation algorithms and run through a single pulse search pipeline to analyse the recovery of the injected pulses. We examine the recovery of the injected single pulses with an emphasis on a number of cases spanning a range of pulse brightness, width and dispersion measure. The efficacy and side effects of a few popular RFI excision methods, namely IQRM, SKF, and ZDMF are evaluated.

Abstract: The high sensitivity of the pyramid wavefront sensor has made it the preferred sensor in high contrast adaptive optics systems. Future higher contrast systems, like the Extremely Large Telescope's Planetary Camera System, will require higher performance wavefront sensing. A further performance improvement could be achieved with a polychromatic pyramid wavefront sensor by using additional information over a broader wavelength range. The development of such systems is becoming more feasible with the emergence of new detector technologies such as Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector arrays. These are arrays of superconductor detectors that give a position, arrival time and measure of the energy for each incident photon. This paper introduces the polychromatic pyramid wavefront sensor concept by defining the technologies and techniques employed and their requirements. A method is developed to track the optical gains, taking advantage of the additional wavelength information, and used to compensate for optical gains within an optimised reconstructor to minimise noise propagation. An overview of expected performance improvement, using end-to-end simulations, is provided using the Keck II adaptive optics system as a reference design. The polychromatic pyramid wavefront sensor was shown to increase the limiting magnitude by 1 to 2 magnitudes, and the contrast by factors of 1.5 to 4, versus single band pyramid wavefront sensors, by sensing over a wavelength range approximately five to ten times broader (800-1800 nm) compared to Z band (152 nm wide) and H band (300 nm wide). Practical design and implementation issues have also been considered.
