This results in entire optical/digital systems, which are traditionally designed sequentially, i.e. , the adaptive optics system is optimised first, and the restoration algorithms are designed a second time. Studies on optical/digital systems have shown that jointly optimizing the whole system is a better alternative. We propose to extend these co-design strategies to the design of an adaptive optics-assisted imaging system. We derive a simple criterion that takes into account the source properties and the entire optical/ digital system performance. To illustrate its interest, we use it to optimize the wavelength distribution between the wavefront sensor and the imaging camera. In addition, we explore the potential of using multiple imaging channels operating at different wavelengths as a means of making an imaging system robust to turbulence strength and source magnitude variations. Later, any parameter of the optical/digital system, if not the entire system itself, could be optimized this way."}

Therefore, the neighbourhood of the GC black hole is a naive opportunity to test modified theories of gravity. In this work, effect of $f(R)$ gravity near the black hole is studied. The difference of pericentre shift between GR and $f(R)$ gravity is studied for compact orbits having semi-major axis equal to and below $a=1000$ au (S0-2 like orbits). In a model dependent approach, we choose $f(R) \\propto R^2$ (power law gravity) model which is cosmologically motivated and study the deviation in orbital pericentre shift for both zero spin and non-zero spin of the black hole. It is found that effect of $f(R)$ gravity becomes prominent for compact orbits. In model independent approach to $f(R)$ gravity with the generic scalaron fields ($ψ=f'(R)$), we extract the parameters of $f(R)$ gravity from the current bounds on Parametrised Post Newtonian (PPN) parameters ($γ, β$) near the GC black hole. The screening of $f(R)$ gravity is also investigated for these bounds on PPN parameters. It has been found that sufficiently massive scalarons ($10^{-16}$ eV) are completely screened but light and intermediate mass scalarons ($10^{-22}$ eV and $10^{-19}$ eV) are unscreened towards S0-2 like orbits as well as in the orbit of the newly discovered short period star S4716 ($a=407$ au). The possibility of detection of the $f(R)$ gravity effects due to these unscreened scalarons is forecasted with existing and upcoming astrometric capabilities of Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs)."}

The aim of this work is to develop and characterize a modernized standard neutron monitor based on a CHM-15 boron thermal neutron counter and a data acquisition system designed for marine expeditionary studies of cosmic ray variations. Modern nuclear physics experimental methods and the principles of microprocessor-based data acquisition systems were used to solve this problem. The results of test trials and of continuous monitoring showed that the characteristics of the upgraded and standard neutron monitor are similar, and the ease of use, compactness, and stability allow us to conclude that the mobile neutron detector can be used in expeditionary conditions with limited access for maintenance personnel."}

As a noble gas, neon will not deplete into solid form, thus providing a benchmark with abundances determined via UV spectroscopy.

Following an object-oriented approach, the physical entities are modeled as processing objects connected to each other to exchange data objects. A simulation is run by providing its description instead of writing and executing a specific script. The Python language and its library flexibility allowed us to write one single code that can be run on CPU and GPU platforms. We put a strong focus on computational efficiency, relying on CuPy and its interface to access the CUDA-stream mechanism. Moreover, SPECULA is capable of distributed computations over multiple processing nodes, making it suitable to run in an HPC environment, as tested on the Italian supercomputer Leonardo. SPECULA can also be used in laboratory environment to implement a hybrid simulation, allowing us to interface simulated and concrete objects: this feature was demonstrated in the Adaptive Optics laboratories at Arcetri Observatory. In this paper, we describe the main characteristics of SPECULA, show some relevant examples of its use, and finally draw our goals for the future."}

We analyze our model results in conjunction with a review of other relevant theoretical possibilities existing in the literature. We found that modern neutron star observations seem to favor the existence of some type of exotic matter in the neutron star cores; in particular, our slow stable hybrid star scenario remains a proposal capable of satisfying these constraints.

Most emit primarily above 0.3 keV in X-rays, but cooler thermal sources peaking in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) would be much more difficult to detect due to astronomy's critical blind spot in EUV. Here, we report the discovery of a remarkable new class of luminous, point-like, non-nuclear X-ray objects in galaxies-hypersoft X-ray sources -- that have been missed by all previous surveys to date. Detected primarily or exclusively below 0.3 keV, with 0.15-0.3 keV to 0.3-1.0 keV photon ratios >8, the most luminous examples radiate >1E38 erg/s in the narrow X-ray band, with spectral models indicating even greater bolometric luminosities, largely emitted in the EUV. They rank among the most energetic sources in galaxies, yet their EUV-peaking spectra evaded earlier detections. We propose that hypersoft sources are X-ray binaries spanning multiple physical classes, including accreting white dwarfs or post-nova systems-potential Type Ia supernova progenitors-and systems hosting accreting black holes. Beyond their elusive nature, they may play crucial role in ionizing gas within galaxies."}

Besides the low-lying modes, we particularly focus on high overtones, which are physically pertinent due to the substantial deformation of the QNM spectrum triggered by spectral instability. In our algorithm, we expand the wavefunction at the point of discontinuity, instead of the black hole horizon, and incorporate the Israel-Lanczos-Sen junction conditions. %As the wavefunction convergence condition becomes irrelevant, our proposed algorithm generalizes the original method by expanding the wavefunctions at the point of discontinuity, and the associated difficulty is mitigated by rectifying the recurrence relations between the expansion coefficients to incorporate the Israel-Lanczos-Sen junction conditions. We apply this algorithm to compute the QNMs of the modified Regge-Wheeler potential up to $2000$ modes with high precision. For the low-lying modes, the numerical results show excellent agreement with those obtained using the matrix and Prony methods. The high overtones are significantly deformed, owing to the presence of echoes due to the discontinuity. This deformation in the asymptotic QNM spectrum reveals universal features that are largely independent of the specific form of the discontinuity in the potential, seemingly coinciding with those observed in the modified Pöschl-Teller effective potential. We speculate on whether the collective effect of the high overtones has an observational impact on gravitational wave signals."}

Such angular jitter can be measured using the differential wavefront sensing technique, enabling the modeling and subtraction of TTL noise from the data. However, owing to the multiple degrees of freedom of the detector constellation, a linear TTL model requires at least 24 parameters, while a higher-fidelity quadratic model involves up to 60 coefficients, rendering parameter estimation computationally expensive. To accelerate parameter determination, we propose a modified parameter set obtained via a linear transformation of the original angular coupling coefficients, which effectively reduces correlations among TTL noise components. In addition, we perform parameter fitting using an alternative second-generation time-delay interferometry configuration, PD4L, rather than the fiducial Michelson configuration. These two improvements enhance the convergence speed of the fitting procedure by a factor of approximately 10 for the linear model and approximately 18 for the quadratic model. The proposed approach can therefore substantially improve the efficiency of TTL noise calibration in space-based gravitational-wave detectors."}

With its wide-field, sensitive all-sky monitoring, the Einstein Probe (EP) has greatly increased the discovery rate of eFXTs. The search and identification of the optical counterparts of eFXT are vital for understanding their classification and constraining their physical origin. Yet, a considerable fraction of eFXTs still lack secure classifications due to the absence of timely follow-up observations. We carry out a systematic search of publicly available optical survey data and transient databases (including the Zwicky Transient Facility, ZTF, and the Transient Name Server, TNS) for optical counterparts to eFXT candidates detected by EP. In this paper, we describe our ongoing program and report the first results. Specifically, we identified the eFXT EP240506a to be associated with a UV/optical counterpart, AT 2024ofs. Spectroscopy of its host galaxy with VLT yields a redshift of $z = 0.120 \\pm 0.002$. By combining archival survey data with early-time multiwavelength observations, we find that the luminosity and light-curve evolution of AT~2024ofs are consistent with a core-collapse supernova origin.

We take the scalar and Maxwell fields as examples. For the non-minimally coupled massless real scalar field with ξRφ^2 term in the Lagrangian (mass can be introduced by shift of ξ), only when ξ\\le 5/48, the quantized Hamiltonian is spontaneously non-negative and the vacuum is well defined. For ξ> 5/48, one has to assign the negative energy spectrum as that of the ghost particles, introducing anti-commutation relations to make the corresponding part of the Hamiltonian trivial, ensuring the Hamiltonian non-negative and the vacuum (and the Hilbert space) well defined. This method of ghost states is applicable once the proper radial boundary conditions guarantee the Hamiltonian self-adjoint. The resulting dynamics can be compared with those resulting from the positive self-adjoint extensions when the latter is available for ξ\\le 9/48. For the Maxwell fields, the gauge invariant canonical energy momentum tensor straightforwardly leads to the gauge invariant non-negative Hamiltonian (well-defined vacuum). Hence the redundant gauge degree of freedom is irrelevant, and the 2-dimensional dynamical degrees of freedom are quantized in a concrete, e.g., temporal gauge. The energy momentum tensors for both quantized fields are renormalized to be finite at operator level, which renders the stable vacuum maximally symmetric. The back-reactions to the background spacetime by excited states via the semi-classical Einstein equations are also discussed."}

Unlike classical black holes, which inevitably culminate in central curvature singularities, our model demonstrates that the SS braneworld dynamics naturally regularize the interior geometry and prevent singularity formation. By solving the modified Einstein field equations induced on the brane, we obtain explicit interior, shell, and exterior solutions without invoking the idealized thin-shell approximation. The gravastar core is modeled as a Bose--Einstein condensate, while the intermediate shell consists of ultra-dense stiff matter. Bulk Weyl corrections induce anisotropic effective pressures on the brane, a feature that emerges intrinsically in this scenario and supports stability. We analyze the active gravitational mass, energy, entropy, and proper thickness of the shell, and establish the junction conditions at the interfaces. Our analysis reveals that the SS gravastar exhibits suppressed or even negative effective mass, reflecting the repulsive nature of the interior condensate, and admits stable equilibrium solutions consistent with energy conditions. This highlights the SS braneworld gravastar as a physically viable compact object and a compelling alternative to black holes. A key novelty of our construction is that the stabilizing pressure anisotropy and suppressed effective gravitational mass arise dynamically from higher-dimensional Weyl corrections, rather than being imposed through ad hoc matter sources or thin-shell idealizations.

Submitted to PRD", "summary": "There is increasing evidence that, in the very late phase of stellar evolution before core collapse, massive stars have winds with large mass loss rates that give rise to a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) surrounding the progenitor star. After core collapse, a shock wave forms when the supernova ejecta interacts with this CSM. In such an interaction, the nuclei in the CSM can undergo diffusive shock acceleration and reach very high energies. We consider such a model, which includes magnetic field amplification from the non-resonant streaming instability, enhancement to the abundance of heavy-ions, and composition-dependent acceleration. Applying this to several supernova subclasses, we find that IIn supernovae can supply a dominant fraction of the observed super-knee cosmic-ray (CR) flux from $\\sim{\\rm few}\\times10^{15}\\,{\\rm eV}$ to $\\sim{\\rm few}\\times10^{17}\\,{\\rm eV}$ and is consistent with recent LHAASO measurements above the CR knee. This systematic model also explains the increasingly heavy nuclear composition in this energy range."}

Such angular jitter can be measured using the differential wavefront sensing technique, enabling the modeling and subtraction of TTL noise from the data. However, owing to the multiple degrees of freedom of the detector constellation, a linear TTL model requires at least 24 parameters, while a higher-fidelity quadratic model involves up to 60 coefficients, rendering parameter estimation computationally expensive. To accelerate parameter determination, we propose a modified parameter set obtained via a linear transformation of the original angular coupling coefficients, which effectively reduces correlations among TTL noise components. In addition, we perform parameter fitting using an alternative second-generation time-delay interferometry configuration, PD4L, rather than the fiducial Michelson configuration. These two improvements enhance the convergence speed of the fitting procedure by a factor of approximately 10 for the linear model and approximately 18 for the quadratic model. The proposed approach can therefore substantially improve the efficiency of TTL noise calibration in space-based gravitational-wave detectors."}

It exhibits two key anomalies: an insufficient rotational energy loss rate to power its observed X-ray luminosity, and a braking index of $ = 1.08\\pm 0.04$, which starkly contradicts the canonical magnetic dipole value of $n=3$. To explain these anomalies, we develop a unified spin-evolution model that self-consistently integrates magnetic dipole radiation, gravitational wave emission, and wind braking. Within this framework, we constrain the wind braking parameter to $κ\\in [13, 37]$ from the nebular properties, finding it contributes substantially (17%-51%) to the current spin-down torque. Bayesian inference reveals that the birth period is poorly constrained by present data and is prior-dependent, indicating a millisecond birth is allowed but not required. Furthermore, we constrain the number of precession cycles to $ξ\\sim 10^{4}$--$10^{5}$, and our analysis favors a toroidally-dominated internal magnetic field configuration as the most self-consistent explanation for the low braking index. Finally, we assess the continuous gravitational-wave detectability. The present-day signal is undetectable. However, the early-time signal might have reached the projected sensitivity of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories, such as the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (aLIGO) and the Einstein Telescope (ET), although a confident detection would require exceptionally stable rotation, an assumption considered highly optimistic for a young magnetar. This work establishes a unified framework that links magnetar spin-down with their interior physics and multi-messenger observables, providing a physically consistent interpretation for Swift J1834.9-0846 and a new tool for understanding similar extreme neutron stars."}

By analytically continuing black hole spacetimes to Euclidean signature, we define timelike correlations that reveal a sequence of timelike Page times at which the entanglement entropy equals the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Applying this framework to Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström, static higher-dimensional and braneworld solutions, four-dimensional Kerr, and higher-dimensional rotating Myers--Perry black holes, we demonstrate that timelike entanglement exhibits periodic or quasi-periodic behavior, with the recurrence times sensitive to surface gravity, charge, rotation, and spacetime dimensionality. Extremal and near-extremal black holes display effectively frozen thermal oscillations with persistent rotational modulation, reflecting their near-horizon geometries. Unlike conventional approaches based on islands or firewalls, our framework encodes information entirely in the Hawking radiation, preserving unitarity while avoiding violations of horizon smoothness. These results establish timelike entanglement as a robust and physically transparent mechanism for information recovery and provide a versatile tool for exploring quantum gravitational dynamics across a wide range of black hole spacetimes."}

Here we consider systems composed of 1 GeV and 10 GeV dark matter. Relevant compact objects are then analysed and simulated as both static bodies, and rotating systems governed by the Hartle-Thorne formalism to second order.

This study proposes chaotic dynamics as a novel indicator for scalar hair in Horndeski gravity. We investigate the motion of a spinning test particle in a static, spherically symmetric hairy black hole spacetime. Our results show that increasing scalar hair systematically suppresses orbital chaos, as evidenced by regularized precession, reduced Lyapunov exponents, and contracted Poincare sections. Furthermore, scalar hair enhances the correlation between the two gravitational wave polarization modes, restoring phase coherence. These findings demonstrate that chaotic observables and gravitational wave signatures can jointly serve as sensitive probes for black hole hair, offering a complementary approach to testing gravity in strong-field regimes."}

The information extracted from the tools included in sensipy can be used to help astronomers investigate the detectability of sources considering various theoretical assumptions about their emission processes and mechanisms.

A New Morphological Study of Tidal Disruption Event Host Galaxies", "comment": "20 pages, 9 figures", "summary": "Host galaxies of tidal disruption events (TDEs) show enhanced central stellar concentration and are preferentially found in post-starburst and green valley populations. This connection has led to the proposal that TDE host galaxies likely have gone through recent mergers. We conduct a new morphological study of 14 TDE host galaxies, using the r-band images from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), and Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), with the images from the latter two surveys having much higher depth and resolution than SDSS. We examine galaxy structures using conventional methods and also apply diagnostics of merger activity from machine learning models. Consistent with previous studies, our results show that TDE host galaxies are ~16% more centrally concentrated when compared to non-TDE-host controls. However, surprisingly, TDE hosts lack any indication of recent merger activity from both morphological analysis and our machine learning merger classifier. Instead, our results reveal that TDE host galaxies are approximately 1.5 to 2.5 times more likely to have bar-like or ring-like structures than their controls. This enhancement is even more prominent for TDEs in the green valley, with the factor reaching almost 3. Based on these results, we propose that bar-driven secular evolution, instead of merger, likely dominates the recent evolution of TDE hosts found in the green valley, which can simultaneously explain their distinctive nuclear properties and enhanced TDE rates."}

However, the lack of updated measurements of its accretion disk, broad line region and dusty torus hampers a detailed interpretation of the role of accretion in the observed $γ$-ray production. We intend to characterize, during high-activity states, the external photon fields contributing to the IR-to-UV emission$-$namely dusty torus, broad line region and accretion disk$-$and investigate potential variability and blurring effects on the broad emission lines. We present new spectroscopic observations of OP 313 with the NOT and TNG telescopes to characterize its optical spectrum and variability with respect to archival observations from SDSS. We measure the luminosity of different broad emission lines, characterizing the broad line region, accretion disk and dusty torus. We measure the Mg II emission line, with an average flux of $F_{\\mathrm{Mg \\ II}} = (0.85 \\pm 0.11)\\times 10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Its equivalent width and luminosity are consistent with a constant line with a variable non-thermal continuum.

Accepted for publication in ApJ", "summary": "Mapping the physical conditions of the shocked plasma of young supernova remnants (SNR) is crucial for understanding their explosion mechanisms, ejecta structure, and large-scale asymmetries. Using $>350$ ks of XRISM/Resolve high spectral resolution observations of Cassiopeia A (Cas A), the youngest known Galactic core-collapse SNR, we present the first microcalorimeter-based plasma parameter maps of any SNR. We tessellate Cas A into $1'\\times1'$ regions and fit the broadband spectra as thermal emission from two pure-metal ejecta components -- corresponding to intermediate-mass elements (IMEs) and iron-group elements (IGEs) -- plus nonthermal synchrotron radiation. For robust inference, we introduce UltraSPEX, a Bayesian framework that couples the SPEX plasma code with the UltraNest nested-sampling algorithm, yielding full posterior distributions and exploration of parameter degeneracies. Key findings include enhanced Ar/Si and Ca/Si abundance ratios near the base of the Si-rich jets, and a high Ni/Fe mass ratio ($0.08\\pm0.015$) in the base of NE jet. IGEs ejecta exhibit systematically higher Doppler velocities and broadenings than IMEs ejecta in most regions, with maximum differences of $\\sim800$ km/s and $\\sim1200$ km/s, respectively; Ca shows distinct (faster) kinematics from other IMEs in several SE regions. The ionization timescale and electron temperature show a robust anti-correlation, particularly for IGEs. This relation and measured parameter values could be explained by semi-analytical models with significant ejecta clumping (overdensities of $\\sim10$ for IGEs and up to $\\sim100$ for IMEs) and reduced historical reverse-shock velocities. Nonthermal emission accounts for a substantial fraction, with at least 47% of the 4--6 keV continuum and dominates in the western regions, where the spectrum hardens."}

Comments welcome. Main arguments presented in Sections 1,2,5&6", "summary": "We revisit the spectral appearance of extended self-gravitating accretion disks around supermassive black holes. Using dust-poor opacity tables, we show that all optically thick disk solutions possess a universal outer effective temperature of $T_{\\rm eff}\\sim 4000-4500$K, closely resembling compact, high-redshift sources known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Assuming the extended disk is primarily heated by stellar sources, this ``disk Hayashi limit\" fixes the dominant optical continuum temperature of the disk spectrum independent of accretion rate $\\dot{M}$, black hole mass $M_\\bullet$, and disk viscosity $α$, and removes the parameter-tuning required in previous disk interpretations of LRDs. We construct global self-gravitating accretion disk models with radially varying accretion rates, suggesting that burning of embedded stellar objects can both efficiently power the emission of the outer disk and hollow out the inner disk, strongly suppressing variable UV/X-ray associated with a standard quasar. The resulting disk emission is dominated by a luminous optical continuum while a separate, non-variable UV component arises from stellar populations on the nuclear to galaxy scale. We map the optimal region of parameter space for such systems and show that LRD-like appearances are guaranteed for $\\dot{M}/α\\gtrsim 0.1 M_\\odot /{\\rm yr}$, a threshold insensitive to $M_\\bullet$, below which the system may transition into classical non-self-gravitating AGN disks, potentially a later evolution stage. We expect this transition to be accompanied by the enhancement of metallicity and production of dust, giving rise to far infrared emission. This picture offers a physically motivated and quantitative framework connecting LRDs with AGNs and their associated nuclear stellar population."}
