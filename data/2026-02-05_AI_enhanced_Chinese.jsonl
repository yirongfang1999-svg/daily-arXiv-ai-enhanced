Through temporal decomposition of the XMM-Newton light curve and time-resolved spectral analysis, we identified broad, thermal flares recurring every $\\sim$12 hours and lasting $\\sim$2 hours, consistent with quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs). Remarkably, these QPEs are accompanied by an unprecedented crest of hotter, shorter flares, each lasting between 5 and 30 minutes. These flares are predominantly found in the rising phases of the QPEs, although they also appear throughout the quiescence. These findings establish J2344 as a new member of the QPE emitter population and uncover a previously unobserved phenomenology that challenges current models of QPEs.

BBH mergers embedded in AGN disks are unique among GW formation channels in their generic ability to produce electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, via interactions between the merger remnant and the surrounding disk gas (though these are not always observable). While such mergers represent valuable multi-messenger sources, the lack of predictive statistical models in existing literature currently limits our ability to select possible EM counterparts with GW detections in archival data and in real time using time-domain surveys such as ZTF or LSST. Here, we employ the Monte Carlo For AGN Channel Testing and Simulation code (\\texttt{McFACTS}\\footnote{https://www.github.com/mcfacts/mcfacts}) to predict the bolometric luminosities of jets and shocks associated with LVK-detectable BBH merger remnants in AGN disks. \\texttt{McFACTS} predicts the distribution of GW observables for an underlying BH population and disk model.

In the limit of a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a zero-net angular momentum flow, accretion is spherical. However, in the presence of a large-scale vertical magnetic field, the classical Bondi accretion model is significantly altered. The frozen-in field is stretched radially as the plasma is pulled inward by gravity. This continues until the restoring force from the magnetic tension suddenly expels the material and resets the field, allowing a new cycle to begin. Although this scenario has been well depicted in previous studies, it remains incomplete as the issues of dissipation and particle acceleration are not yet fully resolved. In this work, we aim to revisit these issues with a first-principles kinetic plasma model. We perform two-dimensional global general relativistic particle-in-cell simulations of magnetized spherical accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole, for both pair and electron-ion plasmas. The simulations are evolved over long timescales to capture multiple flux eruption events and establish a quasi-steady state. For each accretion cycle, we find that the system goes through three main stages: (i) an ideal advection phase where magnetic flux through the horizon increases quasi-linearly with time; (ii) a reconnection-regulated phase where the net increase of the flux is slowed down by intermittent reconnection events near the horizon; and (iii) a flaring phase when a major, large-scale reconnection event expels the flux, leading to efficient particle acceleration. The emergence of large-amplitude quasi-periodic flux eruptions and concomitant particle acceleration is reminiscent of Sgr A* flaring activity. This phenomenon could also be applicable to quiescent black holes, especially isolated black holes accreting the interstellar medium.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

It is interesting to find that the particle sphere equation can reduce to the well-known photon sphere equation, when the particle's initial velocity is equal to the speed of light. We adopt the strong field limit approach to calculate the black-bounce-Schwarzschild deflection angle of the particle subsequently, and obtain the strong-deflection lensing observables of the relativistic images of a pointlike particle source. The observables mainly include the apparent angular particle sphere radius, the angular separation between the outermost relativistic image and the other ones which are packed together, and the ratio between the particle-flux magnification of the outermost image and that of the packed ones (or equivalently, their resulted magnitudelike difference). The velocity effects induced by the deviation of the initial velocity of the particle from light speed on the corresponding strong-field lensing observables of the images of a pointlike light source in the regular geometry, along with these on the strong deflection limit coefficients and the critical impact parameter of the lightlike case, are then formulated.

Using Bayesian inference with the state-of-the-art eccentric, spin-aligned, higher-mode effective-one-body model SEOBNRv5EHM, we reanalyze six previously suggested eccentric gravitational-wave events--GW190521, GW190620, GW190701, GW191109, GW200129, and GW200208\\_222617. Comparing results with its dominant-mode-only counterpart SEOBNRv5E, we find no statistically significant HOM-induced bias in eccentricity for any of these events, including GW190521, whose eccentricity has been debated in the literature. To identify parameter regimes vulnerable to HOM omission, we perform a broad zero-noise injection campaign varying detector-frame total mass, mass ratio, eccentricity, inclination, and network SNR. We find that significant systematic biases ($\u0394_e/\u03c3> 1$) arise predominantly in systems with high total mass ($M^{\\rm det}\\gtrsim120M_\\odot$), highly asymmetric mass ratios ($q \\gtrsim 4$), near edge-on orientations ($\u03b8_\\textrm{JN} \\gtrsim 30^\\circ$), and high SNRs ($\u03c1^N_\\textrm{mf}\\approx50$). Notably, for quasi-circular BBHs with $M^{\\rm det}\\gtrsim140M_\\odot$, neglecting HOMs may lead to strong false-positive evidence for nonzero eccentricity. By contrast, for lower-mass systems ($M^{\\rm det}\\sim100 M_\\odot$), HOM exclusion produces negligible eccentricity biases. Our results demonstrate that although current eccentric candidates are not impacted by HOM omission, future eccentricity measurements--particularly for massive, asymmetric, or edge-on systems--require HOM-inclusive waveforms to avoid substantial systematic errors.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

For different categories of spacetimes (or gravitational sources), the existence of photon spheres and their distributions are dramatically influenced by the geometric and topological properties of spacetimes and characteristics of the corresponding gravitational fields. In this work, we carry out a geometric analysis on photon spheres for different categories of spacetime (including black hole spacetime, ultra-compact object's spacetime, regular spacetime, and naked singularity spacetime). Some universal properties and conclusions are obtained for these spacetimes. We mostly focus on the existence of photon spheres, the total number of photon spheres $n = n_{\\text{stable}} + n_{\\text{unstable}}$, the subtraction of stable photon sphere and unstable photon sphere $w = n_{\\text{stable}} - n_{\\text{unstable}}$ in different categories of spacetimes. These conclusions are derived solely from geometric properties of optical geometry of spacetimes, irrelevant to the specific spacetime metric forms. Besides, our results successfully recover some important theorems on photon spheres proposed in recent years.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
