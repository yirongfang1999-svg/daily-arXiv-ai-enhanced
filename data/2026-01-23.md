Abstract: We present OmniSpectra, the first native-resolution foundation model for astronomy spectra. Unlike traditional models, which are limited to fixed-length input sizes or configurations, OmniSpectra handles spectra of any length at their original size, without resampling or interpolation. Despite the large-scale spectroscopic data from diverse surveys fueling the rapid growth of astronomy, existing foundation models are limited to a fixed wavelength range and specific instruments. OmniSpectra is the first foundation model to learn simultaneously from multiple real-world spectra surveys with different configurations at a large scale. We achieve this by designing a novel architecture with adaptive patching across variable lengths, sinusoidal global wavelength encoding, local positional embeddings through depthwise convolution, and validity-aware self-attention masks. Allowing us to learn multi-scale spatial patterns while skipping attention for invalid patches. Even with a limited training example, OmniSpectra demonstrates excellent zero-shot generalization compared to methods tailored for specific tasks. This transfer learning capability makes this model the state-of-the-art across various astronomy tasks, including source classification, redshift estimation, and properties prediction for stars and galaxies. OmniSpectra reduces the need for training individual models for different tasks from scratch, establishing itself as the next-generation astronomy foundation model.

Abstract: LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, due to launch mid-2035, is a large class space mission by the European Space Agency (ESA). In partnership with NASA and ESA-member states, ESA is on track to launch what is expected to be the first space-based gravitational wave detector. By hosting detectors in space, one gains access to a lower frequency band of gravitational wave sources and with them, a plethora of new science. To maximise this scientific gain, ESA and NASA selected 20 scientists for the LISA Science Team, to carry out and/or lead necessary actions on the run up to LISA launch. We give a short overview and update of the LISA mission, some of its science objectives and related waveforms, as well as the work of the LISA Science Team as of December 2025.

Abstract: A new, iterative algorithm is presented to calculate the Embedded Element Pattern (EEP) tranformation from a set of patterns computed for a uniform antenna port loading (scaled identinty matrix) to a set of those computed for a non-uniform one (arbitrary diagonal matrix). This method proves particularly useful when inverting the computations to derive the non-uniform entries of the arbitrary load, given the minimum number of EEPs necessary, which disposes of the redundancy of other matrix-based computations and leads to numerically stable impedance fault calculation. As the EEPs are envisioned to be obtained primarily through measurement, our method is also tested with the inclusion of various noise components and its convergence is evaluated, suggesting the minimum SNR and fading level of the measurement apparatus, as well as the optimal choice of reference antenna to minimise the estimation error.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accurate determination of fireball direction is essential for retrieving trajectories and velocities. Errors in these measurements have significant implications, affecting the calculated pre-impact orbit, influencing mass estimates, and impacting the accuracy of dark flight simulations, where applicable. Here we implement a new atmospheric refraction correction technique that addresses a significant aspect previously overlooked in the field of meteor science. Traditional refraction correction techniques, originally designed for objects positioned at infinite distances, tend to overcompensate when applied to objects within the Earth's atmosphere. To rectify this issue, our study introduces the concept of the atmospheric refraction delta z correction technique, involving the artificial elevation of the observer site height above sea level. We utilize analytically derived formulas for the delta z correction in conjunction with commonly used refraction models, validating these results against a numerical solution that traces light rays through the atmosphere. This ray-tracing model is applied to finely meshed atmospheric layers, yielding precise correction values. We evaluate multiple sources of error in order to quantify the achievable accuracy of the proposed method. Our approach (1) enables the determination of fireball positions with improved astrometric accuracy, (2) removes the explicit dependence on the fireball distance from the observer or its height above Earth's surface within the limits imposed by realistic atmospheric variability, and (3) simplifies meteor data processing by providing a robust framework for analyzing low-elevation fireball observations, for which atmospheric refraction is significant and is automatically corrected by the method. As a result of this work, we provide open, publicly accessible software for calculating the delta z correction.

Abstract: Reconstructing images of the radio sky from incomplete Fourier information is a key challenge in radio astronomy. In this work, we present a method for radio interferometeic image reconstruction using a data-driven prior for the radio sky based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). We first train a DDPM on radio galaxy observations from the VLA FIRST survey. We create simulated VLA, EHT, and ALMA observations of radio galaxies, then use an unsupervised posterior sampling method called Denoising Diffusion Restoration Models (DDRM) to reconstruct the corresponding images, using our DDPM as a prior. Our approach is agnostic to the measured radio interferometric data and naturally incorporates the physics of the measurement process. We are able to reconstruct images with very high fidelity PSNR>60, a marked improvement over CLEAN and similar image reconstruction methods using conditional DDPMs

Abstract: Wisps are among the most prominent scattered light artifacts in JWST/NIRCam imaging. They often appear in certain regions of the detectors and contaminate observations at surface-brightness levels relevant for faint-source photometry. We introduce a new subtraction method that uses the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm to model and remove wisps. Using deep NIRCam observations from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) and other programs, we construct multi-component, filter- and detector-specific wisp templates that capture the wisp structures and their exposure-to-exposure morphological variations. Wisps in individual exposures are represented as non-negative linear combinations of these templates, consistent with their additive nature and reducing degeneracies relative to single-template scaling. Compared to existing approaches, our method delivers lower residual root mean square in wisp-affected regions and reduces photometric bias and scatter to levels consistent with clean detector areas. The NMF wisp templates are readily applicable to other datasets and are publicly released to support future NIRCam extragalactic surveys.

Abstract: FarView is a proposed low frequency radio interferometer for deployment on the lunar far side, enabled by the Moon's radio quiet environment. Operating over 1-50 MHz inaccessible from Earth, FarView will open a new observational window and promote discovery class science in cosmology, heliophysics, Galactic and exoplanet astrophysics. The primary science is measurement of the redshifted 21 cm signal from the Cosmic Dark Ages (z=30-100), identified by the Astro2020 Decadal Survey as a priority cosmology discovery area. FarView will deliver 3D tomographic measurements and precision power spectra of neutral hydrogen in a largely linear regime, enabling tests of inflationary initial conditions, primordial non Gaussianity, dark matter properties, neutrino masses, and early dark energy. The reference design consists of 100000 crossed dipole antennas in a dense core-halo configuration spanning 200 sq km. A compact 4 km core with 83000 dipoles maximizes sensitivity to large scale cosmological modes, while 20000 halo elements extending to 14 km provide angular resolution and calibration for foreground characterization. Sensitivity forecasts indicate a 10-sigma detection of the Dark Ages 21 cm power spectrum at z=30 over five years of half duty cycle lunar night observations. An FFT-based EPIC beamformer is identified as an efficient signal processing architecture. Beyond cosmology, FarView will enable interferometric imaging of low frequency solar radio bursts, advancing space weather studies. Additional capabilities include stellar space weather observations, Galactic cosmic ray tomography via free-free absorption, and searches for auroral radio emission from exoplanet magnetospheres, a probe of exoplanet habitability. FarView represents a flagship class opportunity to establish the Moon as a platform for foundational astrophysics while delivering unique observational capabilities.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A recent result of Jaracz has established nonexistence of global solutions to the coupled generalized Jang equation and zero divergence system which satisfy the asymptotic conditions needed to prove the Penrose conjecture by identifying a breakdown mechanism for the Jang slope at finite radius. In this work, we investigate whether a similar obstruction arises when the generalized Jang equation is instead coupled to the conformal flow of metrics. Restricting to spherical symmetry and time-symmetric initial data, we formulate a numerically tractable version of the Jang/conformal flow system. Our numerical results show no evidence of a finite radius breakdown analogous to that observed by Jaracz. Instead, the Jang slope remains regular and approaches its limiting value asymptotically. This behavior persists under controlled perturbations of the warping factor, indicating robustness of the observed phenomenon. These findings suggest that coupling to conformal flow of metrics alters the obstruction mechanism present in the Jang/zero divergence system, and hence that this system may still be viable for proving the Penrose conjecture.

Abstract: Inspired by regular black holes (RBHs) sourced by dark matter halos, we generalize the anisotropic energy-momentum tensor by relaxing the $P_r = -ρ$ condition between radial pressure and density. We demonstrate that while RBHs are a unique special case, a broader class of relations yields horizonless compact stars. Under specific parameter limits, these objects approach a ``frozen state," mimicking black hole features without an event horizon. These compact star solutions could satisfy weak energy conditions and provide a robust mechanism for dark matter-sourced black hole mimickers.

Abstract: The formation of a cusp on a black hole shadow is a striking signature of physics beyond the Kerr paradigm. We demonstrate that this morphological change fundamentally alters the shadow's topology with the topological charge flipping from 1 to -1. To analyze this topological transition, we introduce a gravitational equal-area law, analogous to Maxwell's construction in thermodynamics, and identify a critical point for cusp formation. Near this point, we uncover universal behavior characterized by a critical exponent 1/2, which places this gravitational lensing system within the mean-field universality class. These results establish a new framework for testing fundamental physics of black hole shadows, reframing the search for deviations from general relativity as a targeted hunt for a distinct topological and critical phenomenon.

Abstract: The Galactic Center black hole environment gives us new opportunity to test deviation from General Relativity and black hole physics. In this work we analytically generate the shape of the Galactic Center black hole by using a recently developed exact stationary, axisymmetric and vacuum solution of $f(R)$ gravity theory. By using scalaron mass as a free parameter we find that the shadow shape along with displacement and asymmetry is sensitive to the scalaron mass, even after keeping the black hole spin low. We recognize scalaron mass which is compatible with Kerr like quadrupole moment and hence black hole "no-hair" theorem. The same mass scale is found to reproduce the PPN parameter ($γ$) constrained in the weak field limit of the solar system. Gravitational identifiers, the Kretschmann scalar ($κ$) and gravitational potential ($φ$) have been used to infer scalaron masses in the regime of S-stars which are found to be consistent with the limits obtained using shadow scales. We ensure that $f(R)$ gravity scalaron has an appropriate general relativistic limit in the horizon scale of the black hole. We also identify the possibility of scale invariance of the General Relativistic limit.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We develop the covariant phase space formulation of Weyl-transverse gravity (WTG) in the presence of general timelike and spacelike boundaries. WTG is classically equivalent to General Relativity (GR) but possesses a reduced gauge symmetry consisting of Weyl transformations and transverse diffeomorphisms, together with a fixed background volume form. This structure modifies the variational principle and the definition of conserved quantities relative to GR. We derive the symplectic potential, presymplectic current, and Hamiltonian generators associated with transverse diffeomorphisms, and we identify a set of boundary conditions under which the WTG action is differentiable. These include Dirichlet and Neumann conditions for both the auxiliary Weyl-invariant metric and the dynamical metric, as well as a natural implementation of York boundary conditions, for which WTG exhibits a particularly transparent geometric formulation. We obtain the Noether current and surface charge, clarify the role of the Lagrangian ambiguity related to the cosmological constant, and evaluate the Hamiltonian identity on spacetimes containing a bifurcate Killing horizon. The resulting first-law relation shows that variations of the cosmological constant can contribute nontrivially unless additional physical restrictions are imposed.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Nonlinear effects play a fundamental role in the late-time ringdown of black holes, with direct implications for gravitational-wave observations. For massive fields, these dynamics become richer, yet their nonlinear signatures remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically study nonlinear tails of massive scalar perturbations, from a toy model with ingoing and outgoing sources to a self-interacting scalar model, revealing nonlinear tails and contrasting the results with their linear counterparts. We find that the nonlinear tails of massive scalar fields, opposite to massless ones, decay as the same rate as linear tails in the intermediate time, independent of source parameters or initial conditions. Nevertheless, quadratic quasinormal modes could serve as a probe to the nonlinear effects of massive fields.

Abstract: In this work, we show that if the bumblebee field in the Einstein-bumblebee theory is given by its vacuum expectation value ($B_μ=b_μ$) and it is not dynamical ($\partial_μB_ν-\partial_νB_μ=0$), then these conditions uniquely provide a generating technique, allowing us to construct exact solutions to bumblebee gravity from the vacuum solutions by adding a term $\sim b_μb_ν$ to the metric tensor. Also, we show that the bumblebee field within this technique is proportional to the tangential vector of the (timelike or spacelike) geodesic curve in the background vacuum spacetime, and can be easily found knowing the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Moreover, we prove that this technique can be extended to the case of any non-zero cosmological constant and the presence of the electromagnetic field. We apply this generating technique and obtain the bumblebee extension of the Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT-(anti-)de Sitter spacetime. We show that this extension is not unique, as it depends on the exact geodesic curve one chooses to associate a bumblebee field with. Then, by considering various special cases of this generic solution, we demonstrate that the condition of the global reality of the bumblebee field limits the set of geodesics with which we can associate it.

Abstract: Due to the tidal forces that a black hole can produce, certain types of compact objects may undergo disruption as they approach the black hole. This disruption point is known as the Roche limit (or Roche radius). In this work, we studied the tidal forces arising from the presence of the Simpson--Visser black bounce. We analyzed the tidal forces both for a static observer and for a radially infalling observer and showed that differences arise depending on the choice of observer. We used the tidal forces together with the stellar binding forces to determine the Roche radius for neutron stars, white dwarfs, and Sun-like stars, and to investigate how the Simpson--Visser regularization affects the tidal disruption of these astrophysical objects. We also examined whether, for astrophysical black holes such as M87* and Sgr~A*, these stellar disruption processes occur inside or outside the event horizon, and thus whether they are observable.

Abstract: Accreting systems can launch powerful outflows which interact with the surrounding medium. We combine new radio observations of the accreting neutron star X-ray binary (XRB) Circinus X-1 (Cir X-1) with archival radio observations going back 24 years. The $\sim3$ pc scale wide-angle radio and X-ray emitting caps found around Cir X-1 are identified as synchrotron emitting shocks with significant proper motion and morphological evolution on decade timescales. Proper motion measurements of the shocks reveal they are mildly relativistic and decelerating, with apparent velocity of $0.14c\pm0.03c$ at a propagation distance of 2 pc. We demonstrate that these shocks are likely powered by a hidden relativistic ($\gtrsim0.3c$) wide-angle conical outflow launched in $1972\pm3$, in stark contrast to known structures around other XRBs formed by collimated jets over 1000s of years. The minimum time-averaged power of the outflow required to produce the observed synchrotron emission is $\sim0.1L_\text{Edd}$, while the time-averaged power required for the kinetic energy of the shocks is $\sim40 \left(\frac{n}{10^{-2} \text{cm}^{-3}}\right)L_\text{Edd}$, where $n$ is the average ambient medium number density. This reveals the outflow powering the shocks is likely significantly super-Eddington. We measure significant linear polarisation up to $52\pm6\%$ in the shocks demonstrating the presence of an ordered magnetic field of strength $\sim200~μ\text{G}$. We show that the shocks are potential PeVatrons, capable of accelerating electrons to $\sim0.7~\text{PeV}$ and protons to $\sim20~\text{PeV}$, and we estimate the injection and energetic efficiencies of electron acceleration in the shocks. Finally, we predict that next generation gamma-ray facilities may be able to detect hadronic signatures from the shocks.

Abstract: The dynamics of the solid crust + magnetic field lines of pulsars is a much debated issue, and remains unsettled after 50 years. Some pieces of evidence have emerged to complete and confirm theoretical calculations and expectations. We discuss in the present work an interpretation of the behavior of the ''Crab Twin'' pulsar PSR B0540-69 in terms of the evolution of the magnetic field/quakes, connecting the behavior of the braking index with the underlying platelet drift and sudden discontinuous rearrangement (fast-slip) and long-term ones (slow-slip events), suggested by analogy with existing theoretical picture observed in the Earth's crust. The relationship of this scenario with permanent torque-changing glitches seen in the Crab and other young pulsars, and a set of similar events in the same object and others is addressed. We conclude that this physical approach is in principle consistent with all these sudden events, and point out future work to clarify the whole picture.

Abstract: Magnetars are now known to be among the most strongly polarized celestial sources in X-rays. Here we report on the $500\,\mathrm{ks}$ observation of the magnetar 1E 1547.0-5408 performed by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in March 2025. The IXPE spectrum is well reproduced by a single thermal component with blackbody temperature $kT_\mathrm{BB}\sim 0.67\,\mathrm{keV}$ and emission radius $R_\mathrm{BB}\sim 1.2\,\mathrm{km}$. The source exhibits a high linear polarization degree in the $2$--$6\,\mathrm{keV}$ band ($\mathrm{PD}=47.7\pm2.9\%$) with polarization angle $\mathrm{PA}=75^\circ.8 \pm 1.^\circ8$, measured West of celestial North. While $\mathrm{PA}$ does not appear to vary with energy, there is some evidence (at the $1σ$ confidence level) of a minimum in $\mathrm{PD}$ between $3$ and $4\,\mathrm{keV}$, compatible with what is expected by partial mode conversion at the vacuum resonance in a magnetized atmosphere. Phase-resolved spectral and polarimetric analyses reveal that X-ray thermal radiation likely originates from a single, fairly small hot spot with a non-uniform temperature distribution. Fitting the phase-dependent $\mathrm{PA}$ measured by IXPE with a rotating vector model (RVM) constrains the source geometry and indicates that both the dipole axis and line-of-sight are misaligned with respect to the spin axis. Under these conditions, the high polarization of the source cannot be regarded as compelling evidence for the presence of vacuum birefringence in the star magnetosphere. Nevertheless, the fact that the RVM successfully reproduces the modulation of the X-ray polarization angle and the behavior of $\mathrm{PD}$ with the energy hint once more to the presence of QED effects in magnetars.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive catalog of 251 potential counterparts for 250 unassociated hard X-ray sources detected in the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) 150-month hard X-ray survey. Over 150 months of observation, BAT has detected 2339 sources in the 15-150 keV energy range. Among these, 344 do not have a previously identified low-energy counterpart. Our study focuses on the analysis of soft X-ray observations at energies below 10 keV, spatially overlapping with these new Swift-BAT hard X-ray sources. Such observations were taken with Chandra, Swift-XRT, eROSITA, and XMM-Newton. Within the sample of 251 potential counterparts, 94 (37 percent) are identified as active galactic nuclei and 58 (23 percent) as galaxies. The remaining 99 sources (40 percent) include pulsars, cataclysmic variables, and unclassified soft X-ray counterparts in the 0.5-10 keV band. Redshift information is available for 139 out of the 251 sources, and its distribution is in close agreement with the redshift distribution of previous BAT catalogs. We also present the results of a small optical spectroscopy campaign of 9 out of 58 galaxies. The majority of these are classified as Seyfert 2 galaxies at redshifts slightly larger than the median of the BAT AGN sample.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A couple of milliseconds after the merger of a binary system of neutron stars can play a fundamental role in amplifying the comparatively low initial magnetic fields into magnetar strengths. The basic mechanism responsible for this amplification is the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) and we here report the first systematic study of the impact of rapid rotation on the KHI-amplification process exploiting general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations at very high-resolutions of $35\,{\rm m}$. Concentrating on four different spinning configurations, we find that aligned, anti-aligned, and mixed (aligned/anti-aligned) spin configurations lead to markedly different growth rates of the electromagnetic (EM) energy, field topologies, and vortex properties when compared to the irrotational case. These differences arise from intrinsic variations in the system dynamics, such as tidal deformation, collision strength, and contact surface area, with the anti-aligned configuration producing the largest vorticity and growth in EM energy. Importantly, while different spin configurations lead to significantly different initial growth rates of the poloidal/toroidal components, all systems converge to a specific topological partition. Our simulations are confined to a short window in time, but the different EM energies produced as a result of spin will imprint the EM emission at merger and provide information on the spinning state at merger.

Abstract: Massive stars ($M>8\mathrm{M_\odot}$) emit neutrinos known as pre-supernova (pre-SN) neutrinos through thermal and nuclear interactions for cooling the stellar core during the final stage of stellar evolution. Real-time monitoring of their pre-SN neutrino interaction rate offers a crucial opportunity to issue an early warning to a core-collapse supernova. Some neutrino detectors, including KamLAND and Super-Kamiokande already operate pre-SN alarm systems based on a statistically significant excess of the observed event rate over the expected background. To improve alarm sensitivity, we propose an alarm method which incorporates the time evolution of the observed pre-SN neutrino event rate. The method uses a log likelihood ratio test that references multiple theoretical stellar-evolution models and treats the core collapse time as a nuisance parameter to be profiled over. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using simulated data for the KamLAND, Super-Kamiokande with dissolved Gadolinium (SK-Gd) and their combined analysis. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in the warning time compared to the conventional rate-only method, while maintaining the same false alarm rate.

Abstract: GRB~250704B/EP250704a, identified as a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB), exhibited prolonged X-ray emission following the prompt phase and, in optical and infrared (IR) bands, an unusual one-day plateau succeeded by a rapid decline. This sGRB was observed by multiple satellites and ground-based observatories across the electromagnetic spectrum. This study presents temporal and spectral analyses from radio to gamma-ray frequencies, spanning several observation periods beginning after the trigger and continuing for nearly 2 days. The results of the temporal and spectral analyses of the prompt episode, the extended X-ray component, and the afterglow phase are consistent with a millisecond magnetar undergoing accretion. The long-lasting X-ray emission is attributed to the internal energy dissipation of the magnetar spin-down power, governed by the magnetization parameter; the extended optical/IR plateau to synchrotron afterglow emission with energy injection; and the steep decay to changes in microphysical parameters during the post-jet break phase. The X-ray observations are consistent with the superposition of spin-down luminosity and synchrotron afterglow scenario. These findings suggest that the compact-object remnant is most likely a long-lived magnetar.

Abstract: On December 6, 2024, 1ES 1959+650, one of the X-ray brightest blazars known, underwent a high-amplitude X-ray outburst detected by SVOM, the first such discovery with this mission. The source was subsequently monitored with SVOM and Swift from December 2024 to March 2025. We report the detection and multi-wavelength follow-up of this event, and describe the temporal and spectral evolution observed during the campaign. Data from SVOM/MXT, SVOM/ECLAIRs, and Swift/XRT were analyzed with log-parabola models to track flux and spectral variability. The source was detected in a bright state over the 0.3-50 keV range. During the three months of monitoring, the X-ray flux varied significantly, showing episodes of spectral hardening at high flux levels. The spectral curvature evolved more irregularly and did not show a clear trend with flux. A shift of the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) synchrotron peak to higher energies is seen when the flux increases. This constitutes the first blazar outburst discovered in X-rays by SVOM. The coordinated follow-up with Swift provided continuous coverage of the flare and highlights the strong complementarity of the two missions for time-domain studies of blazars. The flare shows no clear signatures of either Fermi I or Fermi II acceleration, suggesting a mixed Fermi I/II scenario.

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are commonly divided into repeating and apparently non-repeating sources, but whether these represent distinct physical populations remains uncertain. In this work, we apply an unsupervised machine learning methods combining Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) with density-based clustering to analyze CHIME/FRB Catalog 2. We find that FRBs remain primarily separated into two clusters in the multi-dimensional parameter space, with a recall of 0.94 for known repeaters, indicating strong robustness. Consistent with Catalog 1 analyses, we confirm that the spectral morphology parameter, specifically spectral running remains the key discriminator between the two populations, indicating that narrowband emission is an intrinsic and persistent property of repeating FRBs. With the enlarged Catalog 2 sample, we further identify a stable subclass of atypical repeaters (about $6\%$ of repeating bursts) that are broadband, shorter in duration, and more luminous, resembling non-repeating bursts. The Nonrepeater-like cluster also shows higher inferred energies and dispersion measures, consistent with a scenario in which apparently non-repeating FRBs may result from observational incompleteness, with low-energy repeating bursts remaining undetected. Our results provide new statistical evidence for a physical connection between repeating and non-repeating FRBs.

Abstract: Magnetars are extreme neutron stars powered by ultra-strong magnetic fields ($\sim10^{14}$ Gauss) and are compelling engines for some of the most powerful extragalactic transients such as Super Luminous Supernovae, Gamma-Ray Bursts, and Fast Radio Bursts. Yet their formation rate relative to ordinary neutron stars remains uncertain, often precluding direct comparisons with the rates of these extragalactic transients. Furthermore, magnetars have been recently shown to be evolutionarily related to other neutron star classes, complicating the estimate of the exact magnetar fraction within the neutron star population. We study the magnetar birth fraction in core-collapse supernovae using pulsar population synthesis of all isolated neutron star classes in our Galaxy, incorporating self-consistently the Galactic dynamical evolution, spin-down and magneto-thermal evolution. This approach allows us to derive strong constraints from small close-to-complete observational samples. In particular, looking at the age-limited young ($<$2 kyr) neutron star population in the Milky Way we find 24 detected young neutron stars, with only 10 of them (41%) being classical rotational powered pulsars, while the others (59%) are either magnetars or central compact objects, the latter believed to be equally magnetically powered. We further compare the results with the nearby volume-limited class ($<$500 pc) of X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron stars, old nearby magnetars. We conclude that the observed population of isolated neutron stars in the Galaxy can be reproduced only by assuming a core-collapse supernova rate larger than two, and a larger magnetar fraction than previously inferred. By assuming a bimodal initial magnetic field ($B_0$) distribution at birth, we find that the magnetar class peaks between $B_0\sim 1-2.5\times10^{14}$ Gauss and represents on average $\sim50$% of the entire neutron star population.

Abstract: As the recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) approaches its next predicted thermonuclear eruption, it is currently exhibiting a "super-active state" (SAS) characterized by enhanced multiwavelength emission similar to the behavior recorded prior to the 1946 outburst. We present a multiwavelength analysis of the SAS and the subsequent "faint state" using observations from HST, Swift, NuSTAR, and XMM-Newton. Our results indicate that the SAS was driven by an increase in the mass accretion rate, which caused the accretion disk's boundary layer to become optically thick. A weighted least squares regression analysis quantifies the evolution of the accretion components, displaying a highly significant (4.5$σ$) increase in the luminosity of the optically thin cooling flow (L$_{cf}$) and a marginal (2.58$σ$) decrease in the optically thick boundary layer luminosity (L$_{bb}$) as the system transitioned into the faint state. We find that this dimming is consistent with an intrinsic change in the accretion flow rather than dust obscuration, supported by the lack of infrared excess and the stability of the 2175 Å feature. Additionally, a time-series analysis using autoregressive modeling to account for correlated red noise revealed no significant periodicities, thereby disputing the previously reported $\sim$6000 s signal. These findings suggest that the pre-outburst evolution of T CrB is characterized by significant changes in the accretion disk structure and boundary layer, providing a self-consistent physical framework for the system's behavior as it approaches eruption.
