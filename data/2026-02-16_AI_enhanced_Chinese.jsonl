Comments are welcome!", "summary": "The catalog of Gravitational Wave (GW) events is rapidly growing, providing key insights into the evolution of massive binaries and compact object formation. However, a key challenge is to explain the origin of exceptional events such as GW190814, among the most asymmetric mass-ratio mergers to date ($q\\approx 0.1$). We show that it shares an evolutionary pathway with the most unequal mass Galactic High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) 4U 1700-37/ HD 153919. We demonstrate this unique connection by utilizing a rich set of existing observational constraints for the HMXB and compute detailed binary evolution models to explain its formation history. We find that conservative mass transfer, along with a directed natal kick are essential to explain its current state. We show that this system is unlikely to form a GW source due to a failed Common Envelope (CE) phase in the future, in agreement with previous work. With additional models, we show that a similar pathway naturally forms GW190814-like events, provided the first phase of mass transfer remains conservative, and the first-born (lower mass) compact object receives a large natal kick ($\\gtrsim 100\\,\\mathrm{km/s}$) for the subsequent CE phase to be successful and form a asymmetric mass-ratio GW source. Anchored by the number of analogous Galactic HMXBs, we estimate rates for such GW events, which broadly agree with their observed rate. Our work demonstrates a unified formation pathway for highly asymmetric mass-ratio HMXBs and GW events. Moreover, it highlights the critical role of finding and characterizing local analogs in different evolutionary phases, and using them as a bridge to understand the origin of GW sources, especially the outliers like GW190814.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are rare transients that provide important insights into the physics of galactic nuclei. A recently identified feature in their optical light curves is the presence of early bump-like structures (precursors) that appear before the onset of the main flare or during its rise. Aims. We aim to build and study the first sample of precursor TDEs in order to improve our understanding of these features, which could be key to revealing the origin of the optical emission in TDEs. Methods. We compiled all known precursor TDEs from the literature, searched for additional candidates, and analyzed them as a sample. Results. We find that precursor TDEs predominantly fall within the repeating TDE, fast TDE, and TDE in active galactic nucleus (AGN) subclasses. We reveal a positive correlation between the occurrence time of the precursors relative to the main peak and the central black hole mass. Conclusions. We suggest that the precursors appear due to interactions between the incoming stellar debris and the disk or leftover material from an earlier disruption (repeating and fast TDEs) or a stable pre-existing disk (TDEs in AGNs). Precursors are therefore potentially key signatures of repeating partial TDEs in previously quiescent galaxies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, standard analyses typically rely on \\emph{ad hoc} hotspot parameterizations rather than self-consistent physical models. While connecting surface heating directly to the magnetospheric geometry provides a more natural physical pathway, computing global magnetospheric solutions is too computationally expensive to perform on-the-fly during parameter inference. In this work, we bridge this gap by deriving fully analytic, first-principles expressions for surface return currents in mixed dipole--quadrupole magnetospheres. Working within force-free electrodynamics, we generalize the field-aligned current invariant $\u039b$, the crucial scalar that maps the far-zone magnetic structure to the near-zone heating rate, from the standard dipole approximation to arbitrary quadrupolar configurations. We demonstrate that even when the quadrupole component is sub-dominant in the far zone (the mixing regime), using a dipole-based heating prescription fails to capture the significant enhancement or suppression of the return-current density on the polar cap. Our consistent quadrupole-aware framework reveals that these multipolar currents redistribute the surface heating, leading to systematic discrepancies in predicted pulse profiles that are amplified by atmosphere beaming and can reach $\\sim 30\\%$ near pulse peaks.

A commonly used prior, uniform in spin magnitudes and isotropic in spin directions, assigns vanishing probability density to spin-orbit-aligned configurations, potentially biasing inferences for BBH parameters. The prior choice can also affect population-level analyses by degrading the convergence of Monte Carlo integrations used to evaluate the likelihood in hierarchical Bayesian inference. In this work, we propose a novel spin prior that is uniform in the effective spin parameters Xeff and Xp, two spin combinations that can be relatively well measured from GW data, conditioned on the mass ratio. Using simulated BBH populations, we show that the inferred spin population can depend on the choice of prior, and that the proposed prior more accurately recovers the underlying spin population, particularly when the true distribution favors aligned-spin configurations.

However, the efficiency of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) is expected to be reduced in the low-Mach-number, weakly turbulent environments characteristic of cluster merger shocks, and recent results suggest that DSA itself may not constitute a viable physical mechanism. In this work, we investigate ballistic surfing acceleration (BSA) as an electrodynamically grounded mechanism for electron energization that does not rely on prescribed diffusion coefficients. We formulate BSA under typical cluster shock conditions and derive the balance between coherent acceleration by the shock convection electric field and radiative losses due to synchrotron and inverse-Compton cooling. This balance determines both the maximum electron energy and the resulting steady-state spectrum. By forward-modeling the associated synchrotron emission and comparing it with integrated radio observations of the Sausage and Toothbrush relics, we find that the observed spectral curvature and high-frequency steepening can be reproduced when only a very small fraction ($\\sim 10^{-9} - 10^{-8}$) of the available BSA acceleration capacity contributes to systematic electron energization. Despite this extremely small efficiency, it is sufficient to accelerate electrons to Lorentz factors $\u03b3\\sim 10^4 - 10^5$ under cluster conditions.

Spins, on the other hand, are poorly constrained: the median of the best-measured spin component of the population, the effective spin, is $\u03c7_{\\rm eff}=0.04$, with a typical $90%$ credible uncertainty of $\u0394\u03c7_{\\rm eff}=0.44$. The large majority -- $90%$ of the observed black holes -- are consistent with spin magnitudes $\u03c7<0.57$ and are weakly aligned with the orbits. At $90%$ credibility, the peaks of the inferred posteriors for spin magnitude are found to lie in the range $0.01$--$0.23$.\n  We show that this ``near-zero spins'' conclusion may be prior-driven, and that uniform-in-magnitude spin priors lead to under-exploration of the moderate-to-high spin region of parameter space. Adopting a physically agnostic prior that is uniform in spin-vector configuration space (i.e., spin states uniform within a unit sphere) yields similar constraints on $\u03c7_{\\rm eff}$, but substantially different spin-magnitude inferences than GWTC-4.0. The resulting shift in spins directly impacts tests of general relativity, constraints on near-extremal Kerr remnants, and astrophysical conclusions, including diagnostics of formation channels and hierarchical growth. In short, the data do not require vanishing spins -- the prior does, and accounting for this is essential for robust GR tests and population inferences.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This array offers a significant improvement in field of view, aperture efficiency, bandwidth, chromaticity and survey speed compared with conventional horn-fed receivers. We demonstrate this with measurements of sky calibrators and observations of 21-cm neutral hydrogen (HI) in the LMC and the nearby galaxy NGC 6744. Within 0.3 deg of the optical axis, the ratio of system temperature to dish aperture efficiency is 25 K and the ratio with beam efficiency is 21 K (at 1.4 GHz). For the previously measured $T_{sys} = 17$ K, respective efficiency values 0.7 and 0.8 are derived. Our HI observational results are in good agreement with previous results, although detailed comparison with multibeam observations of the LMC suggests that the earlier observations may have missed an extended component of low-column-density gas ($8\\times 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$). We use the cryoPAF zoom-band and wideband data to make a preliminary investigation of whether the large number of simultaneous beams (72) permits the use of novel data reduction methods to reduce the effects of foreground/background continuum contamination and RFI. We also investigate if these methods can better protect against signal loss for the detection of faint, extended cosmological signals such as HI intensity maps. Using robust higher-order singular value decomposition (SVD) techniques, we find encouraging results for the detection of both compact and extended sources, including challenging conditions with high RFI occupancy and significant sky continuum structure. Examples are shown that demonstrate that 3D SVD techniques offer a significant improvement in noise reduction and signal capture compared with more traditional layered 2D techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

At those frequencies, the dominant signal is expected to be a stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) produced by the incoherent superposition of the quasi-monochromatic GW emissions from a population of supermassive black hole binaries. While the radio PTAs have recently announced compelling evidence for a GWB signal with a power law spectrum of strain amplitude $\\approx2-3\\times10^{-15}$ (at the frequency of $1 {\\rm yr}^{-1}$), in 2022 an analysis of $12.5$ years of Fermi data for 35 pulsars led to an upper limit of $1\\times10^{-14}$ for the GWB amplitude. The analysis was carried out on times-of-arrival (TOAs) obtained by folding from six months up to one year of photon observations. A photon-by-photon approach was also tested to infer constraints on the GWB amplitude from individual pulsars, but without accounting for the cross-pulsar correlations that a GWB would induce. Here, we reanalyse the same dataset using a regularized likelihood method that correctly models cross-pulsar correlations directly from the photons, while additionally marginalising over the uncertain pulse profile shape. While the two methods are not expected to have significant differences in sensitivity, we prove through simulations of gamma-ray PTA datasets that the photon-by-photon method for GWB recoveries is, statistically, more robust. The resulting upper limit obtained for the GWB strain amplitude is $1.2\\times10^{-14}$, indicating that the improved method yields a consistent result with the previous analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Photometric classification offers a scalable alternative, enabling the identification of larger, fainter, and higher-redshift supernova samples suitable for applications such as Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) cosmology. We present a feature-based photometric classifier for SNe detected by ZTF, with the primary goal of constructing a photometric SN Ia sample for cosmological analyses. Our approach utilises the autoencoder architecture of ParSNIP (Boone 2021) to capture the intrinsic diversity of SN light curves. We trained the model on a spectroscopically classified ZTF SN sample, incorporating a realistic noise augmentation procedure that simulates the flux uncertainties of fainter sources. Light curve features were used to train a gradient-boosted decision tree classifier, implemented in both binary (SN Ia vs. non-Ia) and multi-class configurations. We validated our classifier on independent, fainter ZTF data with and without noise augmentation. To evaluate real-time performance, we also applied our classifier to live ZTF alerts and conducted a spectroscopic classification survey within the ePESSTO+ collaboration. We found that noise augmentation significantly improves classification performance, particularly for fainter sources. Our binary classifier achieves an SN Ia recall of (98.1 $\\pm$ 0.4)%, averaged across five train-test splits. SN Ia recall exceeds 98% for events with a peak apparent magnitude up to 20 and more than 10 detections, and remains above 96% up to magnitude 20.5.
