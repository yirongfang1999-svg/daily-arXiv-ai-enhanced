Abstract: In this work, we investigate exact black string solutions in the context of $f(R,T)$ gravity. Adopting the specific form $f(R,T) = R + 2χT$, we consider an anisotropic Kiselev fluid as the matter content and obtain static cylindrical solutions, which are then extended to the rotating case through a suitable coordinate transformation. The influence of the quintessence state parameter $w_q$ and the matter--geometry coupling constant $χ$ on the geometry is analyzed. We examine the weak, null, and strong energy conditions, identifying the regions in the parameter space where they are satisfied. Furthermore, we apply the Hamilton--Jacobi method to study the tunneling of scalar particles across the event horizon and derive the corresponding Hawking temperature. The thermodynamic stability of the solutions is investigated by computing the heat capacity, and the conditions for phase transitions are discussed. The results provide a characterization of black strings in $f(R,T)$ gravity surrounded by quintessence, highlighting the combined effects of anisotropic matter and modified gravity on their physical properties.

Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive study of energy extraction via the Comisso-Asenjo magnetic reconnection mechanism from rotating charged black holes in the context of Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity. We systematically investigate the influence of various parameters on the energy extraction process, comparing the results in two distinct regions: the circular orbit region and the plunging region. {The results reveal that the Lorentz-violating parameter has a significant impact on energy extraction, affecting not only the parameter space where energy extraction is possible, but also the energy extraction power and efficiency.} It is found that the energy extraction process in the circular orbit region can offer a promising avenue for constraining KR gravity. In contrast, although energy extraction from the plunging region remains feasible even for black holes with relatively low spins and takes place nearer to the event horizon, its sensitivity to the Lorentz-violating parameter is significantly reduced. Overall, the Comisso-Asenjo magnetic reconnection mechanism can serve as a probe of the KR field, particularly through the energy extraction process in the circular orbit region.

Abstract: The authors wished to document the sensitivity improvement that has been contributed to the GW detection rate by detection algorithm research and development efforts, and set about re-analyzing S5 and S6 to determine the sensitive time-volumes of a modern pipeline and compare them to that of analysis algorithms of the day. To our surprise, this effort led to the discovery of GW070605, what at first appeared to be a previously unreported high significance binary neutron star merger at a time when only the Livingston detector (L1) was operating -- data that could not have been analyzed and a signal that could not have been discovered previously because the algorithms of the day required coincidence between two or more detectors. GW070605's end time occurs in LIGO's L1 detector at 2007-06-05 18:37:02 UTC, and is estimated to be a merger with component masses of 1.82$M_\odot$ and 1.24$M_\odot$. The GstLAL detection algorithm estimates that noise processes produce false positives at least as significant as GW070605 at a rate of $8.6\times10^{-10}$ per year. Disappointingly, subsequent investigations revealed the presence of a previously undocumented hardware injection in the L1 detector's Y arm end test mass' excitation channel, whose time and properties match that of GW070605. The injection does not appear in the Gravitational Wave Open Science Center list of hardware injections. We determined that while there is no sensitivity improvement between GstLAL and previous algorithms at the null-result threshold, there is marked improvement at above null-result thresholds; specifically, an approximately 55-times detection rate increase from initial-era algorithms at a FAR threshold of 1 per 7000 years.

Abstract: We present a new analytic model of force-free electromagnetic jet launched from a disk-fed rotating black hole. The jet solution is obtained through a systematic construction from previously developed methods. The resulting physical jet solution exhibits an asymptotically parabolic structure and is parametrized by the location of localized current concentration and sign reversal in the disk. We find, however, that the jet properties show negligible dependence on the disk parameter. The black hole jet captures the basic feature of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism for energy extraction and jet formation.

Abstract: We study the propagation of a constant speed gaussian scalar field wave-packet (GWP) in Minkowski space, showing that the energy conditions are violated for superluminal speed. We then apply the effective speed approach to the GWP propagation, deriving the corresponding effective metric, effective Lagrangian and effective stress-energy tensor, showing that the null, weak and strong energy conditions are satisfied.

Abstract: We present independent imaging analyses of Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of the active galactic nuclei in radio galaxy Centaurus~A and quasar 3C~279 using Generative Deep learning Image Reconstruction with Closure Terms (GenDIReCT), a recently developed machine-learning framework built on conditional diffusion models that uses interferometric closure invariants as primary observables. For Centaurus~A, our reconstruction reveals two prominent emission ridges ($\simeq 80\,μ$as each) along the jet sheath with a brightness ratio of $1.4\pm 0.1$ and an opening angle of $12.3\pm 0.3$~deg. For 3C~279, we identify three distinct components in the image, with the southern jet ejecta on sub-parsec scale exhibiting a proper motion of $4.6\pm 1.0\,μ$as over $\approx 5.39$ days away from the northern components, corresponding to an apparent superluminal velocity of $\simeq 10\pm 2$ times light speed. These measurements are consistent with those reported by the EHT Collaboration. The results are significant because we demonstrate that: (1) imaging from interferometric aperture synthesis data, especially in VLBI and most acutely in extremely sparse arrays like the EHT, remains a severely ill-posed and challenging inverse problem, yet closure invariants preserve robust morphological information that can strongly constrain structural features, and (2) more importantly, closure-invariant imaging largely avoids calibration systematics, thus providing a fundamentally independent view of spatial structure with very high angular resolution. The generative nature of GenDIReCT further allows us to sample and characterise clusters of plausible image solutions for each dataset. As a calibration-independent, generative imaging approach, GenDIReCT offers a robust and truly independent blind-imaging tool for current and future VLBI experiments.

Abstract: Waves launched from the neutron star surface or inner magnetosphere propagate through the magnetosphere as small perturbations, but can grow relative to the background magnetic field and steepen into ``monster shocks'' -- ultra-relativistic magnetized shocks which can power high-energy emission from magnetars, neutron star mergers and collapse. They occur in magnetically dominated plasma and are described by relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We present global relativistic MHD simulations of monster shocks in unperturbed and perturbed (``wrinkled'') backgrounds with a global dipolar geometry. Our simulations confirm analytical predictions for equatorial shocks and provide new insight into the behavior of oblique shocks off the equator. Simulations where the shock is formed through Alfvén mode to fast mode conversion are also presented, demonstrating the generic nature of the monster shock mechanism. We explore how the presence of additional modes in the magnetosphere modifies the shock behavior. Modes of comparable amplitude can fragment the shock front, substantially reduce the magnetization, produce localized enhancements in the Lorentz factor relative to an unperturbed dipole background, and intermittently generate additional shocks along a line of sight.

Abstract: The detection of ultra-high energy neutrinos (UHE-$ν$), with enegies above 10 PeV, has been a long-time goal in astroparticle physics. Autonomous, radio-frequency (RF) UHE-$ν$ detetectors have been deployed in polar regions that rely on the Askaryan effect in ice for the neutrino signal. The Askaryan effect occurs when the excess negative charge within a UHE-$ν$ cascade radiates in a dense medium. UHE-$ν$ can induce cascades that radiate in the RF bandwidth above thermal backgrounds. To identify UHE-$ν$ signals in data from Askaryan-class detectors, analytic models of the Askaryan electromagnetic field have been created and matched to simulations and laboratory measurements. These models describe the Askaryan electromagnetic field, but leave the effects of signal propagation through polar ice and RF channel response to simulations. In this work, a fully analytic Askaryan model that accounts for these effects is presented. First, formulas for the observed voltage trace and its Hilbert envelope are calculated. Second, the analytic model is compared to UHE-$ν$ signals at 100 PeV from NuRadioMC, a key Monte Carlo toolset in the field. Correlation coefficients between the analytic signal envelope and MC data in excess of $0.94$ are found, and 99.99% of UHE-$ν$ signals pass a correlation threshold of $ρ\geq 0.4$. Analysis of RF thermal noise reveals that just 0.2 background events have $ρ\geq 0.4$ in 5 years at a 1 Hz thermal trigger rate. Finally, we describe future work related to the measurement of the logarithm of the UHE-$ν$ cascade energy.
