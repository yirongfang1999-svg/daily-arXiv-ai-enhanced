Abstract: We present a minimal relativistic completion of MOND in which (i) General Relativity is recovered exactly in the high-acceleration regime, while (ii) the Bekenstein--Milgrom (AQUAL) equation emerges in the low-acceleration regime, without introducing additional propagating fields beyond those already present in a right-handed gauge sector. The construction is motivated by an $E_6\times E_6$ framework in which $SU(3)_R\rightarrow SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{Y'}\rightarrow U(1)_{\rm dem}$, leaving a healthy repulsive $U(1)_{\rm dem}$ interaction whose charge is the square-root mass label. Gravity itself arises from the $SU(2)_R$ connection via a Plebanski/MacDowell--Mansouri mechanism, yielding an emergent tetrad and the Einstein--Hilbert action. MOND is implemented by an infrared (IR) metric deformation $ΔS_{\rm IR}[g]$ that is UV-vanishing (so GR is recovered) while its deep-MOND/static limit is fixed by a symmetry principle: in three spatial dimensions, the deep-MOND action is conformally invariant with a 10-parameter group isomorphic to $SO(4,1)$ (the de Sitter group). The single MOND acceleration scale is set by a de Sitter radius selected dynamically in the IR, $a_0=c^2/(ξ\,\ell_{\rm dS})$ with $ξ={ O}(1)$ fixed by matching to the static limit. MOND resides in perturbations and quasistatic systems; the homogeneous FRW background is controlled by the IR vacuum kinematics rather than an ad hoc cosmological constant.

Abstract: Gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers yield values for both the black hole remnant mass $M$ and it's spin $a$, with the $169$ $a$ values collected so far crowding significantly around their average $\bar{a}=0.6869\pm 0.087$. Could this crowding relate directly to the Davies phase transition point at $a=0.68125$ from black hole thermodynamics? I argue that a necessary challenge for such a connection requires a consistent application of the thermodynamic fluctuation theory that follows from black hole thermodynamics (BHT). Specifically, necessary are a correct choice of fluctuating variables, as well as thermal equilibrium between the event horizon at the Hawking temperature $\sim μK$ and the outside universe $\sim 3 K$. I show that the former requirement follows in straightforward fashion from the BHT of the Kerr model, while the later requires an accretion disk following the Novikov-Thorne accretion disk model. I construct a thermodynamic fluctuation theory meeting both these requirements. My results open the possibility that black hole mergers are based on some dynamical model (not known to me) with a limiting attractor state at the Davies point.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the occurrence of late-time cosmological singularities, namely, the rip scenarios within the framework of interacting Fractional Holographic Dark Energy (FHDE). We start our investigation with the Granda-Oliveros (GO) cutoff, i.e., $L=(γH^{2}+δ\dot{H})^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, and highlight the range of allowed $α$ (Lévy's index) values for which big, little and pseudo rip can occur. In particular, we highlight the occurrence of a big rip for fractional values of the Lévy's index in the allowed range $1<α\leq2$. Moreover, we conclude that the occurrence of a pseudo-rip requires Lévy's index to be $α>2$. Therefore, we reject the possibility of pseudo-rip within the GO cutoff. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the occurrence of the little rip in FHDE equipped with a GO cutoff is rather contrived and requires a specific functional form of the IR cutoff $L\sim(γH^{2}+g(H))^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, which belongs to a larger class of Nojiri-Odintsov (NO) cutoffs. To extend our perspective beyond the GO cutoff, we investigate the interacting FHDE framework equipped with the Hubble cutoff, i.e., $L=H^{-1}$, in developing an ansatz-based approach to the little and pseudo-rip singularities as they fail to appear in the GO cutoff. Within this approach, we invoke the expression of the Hubble parameter, $H(t)$, which corresponds to the little and pseudo-rip, into the cosmological parameters such as the Equation of State (EoS) and Squared Sound Speed (SSS) as a function of cosmic time $t$. We produce numerical plots of these parameters in both linear and non-linear $Q$ regimes, which supplement our theoretical findings. In summary, our results highlight the occurrence of little and pseudo-rip singularities within a Hubble cutoff for a non-linear $Q$ term within the FHDE framework.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The analysis of phase transitions in cosmological spacetimes shows that their existence requires a time-dependent apparent horizon radius, which in turn implies an equation of state different from that of a dark energy fluid. This condition is not compatible with the simultaneous fulfillment of Hayward's unified gravitational first law and the fundamental thermodynamic equation of the apparent horizon. To solve this problem, we introduce an alternative formulation in which the cosmological horizon is modeled as a quasi-homogeneous thermodynamic system. We apply this approach to the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe under quantum gravity corrections encoded by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), promote the deformation parameter to a thermodynamic variable, and obtain a consistent thermodynamic description without relying on the usual pressure-volume interpretation. Using Geometrothermodynamics (GTD), we show that fluctuations of the GUP parameter can induce phase transitions closely resembling those of black hole configurations. Finally, we perform a numerical analysis of the behavior of the GTD scalar curvature near the phase transition point, where we find a scaling behavior characterized by the critical exponent close to 1, independently of the dimension of the equilibrium space. This reveals that quantum gravity corrections not only modify the thermodynamic consistency of cosmological models but also strengthen the notion of thermodynamic universality across gravitational systems. Our findings confirm GTD as a powerful geometric tool to unveil the emergent thermodynamic microstructure of spacetime.

Abstract: We study inflationary dynamics within the framework of fractal cosmology, where spacetime exhibits a non-integer effective dimension, sourced through a relaxation of the cosmological principle. Using Friedmann and continuity equations, modified by an effective fractal dimension $D$; we derive generalized slow-roll parameters and examine their evolution for cubic, Starobinsky and Natural inflationary potentials. We then formulate a fractal extension of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation by introducing an effective momentum term $k_{\text{eff}}$, arising from the fractal decomposition of the spatial Laplacian, that captures the geometric influence of fractal cosmology on scalar perturbations. This leads to corrections in the power spectrum and a scalar spectral index $n_s$ that depends explicitly on both the fractal dimension $D$ and a fractional scale $L$, which controls the strength of the fractal deformation. Comparison with the Planck 2018 data ($n_s=0.9649\pm 0.0042$) constrains the allowed range of $D$ ($2.7\lesssim D\lesssim3$) depending on the cosmological and inflationary model assumed.

Abstract: The aim of this work is to improve understanding of the resonant spectra of black holes under perturbations arising from e.g. compact objects or accretion disks in their vicinity. It is known that adding a weak perturbation to the radial potential can strongly disrupt the spectrum of quasinormal modes and Regge poles of a black hole spacetime. Here we examine the effect of (weak or strong) localised delta-function perturbations on the resonant spectra of spherically-symmetric systems, to address fundamental questions around linear and non-linear spectral stability. We examine two cases: the Nariai spacetime with a Poschl-Teller potential and the Schwarzschild spacetime. We show that, in either case, the spectrum deforms in a smooth and continuous manner as the position and strength of the perturbation is varied. As the strength of the perturbation is increased, resonances migrate along trajectories in the complex plane which ultimately tend towards attracting points determined by a hard-wall scenario. However, for weak perturbations the trajectory near the unperturbed resonance is typically strongly influenced by a set of repelling points which, for perturbations far from the system, lie very close to the unperturbed resonances; hence there arises a non-linear instability (i.e. the failure of a linearised approximation). Taking a dynamical systems perspective, the sets of attracting and repelling spectral points follow their own trajectories as the position of the perturbation is varied, and these are tracked and understood.

Abstract: We construct models for first- and second-order Fermi acceleration of particles, incorporating generic frame transformations, dispersion relations, and conservation laws. Within this framework, we study deformations of Lorentz symmetry via the $κ$-Poincaré algebra in the bicrossproduct and classical bases, which respectively deform and preserve the relativistic dispersion relation. We also examine explicit Lorentz symmetry violation and compare the results with deformed relativity and special relativity.

Abstract: This work investigates the optical properties of a static, spherically symmetric, electrically charged black hole in f(R) gravity coupled to Euler-Heisenberg(EH) nonlinear electrodynamics(NLED). By analyzing photon trajectories in this background spacetime, we show how the model parameters affect light propagation, leading to wider ranges of lensed trajectories and photon rings. We identify regions of parameter space that admit physically consistent black hole shadows, characterized by the existence of a photon sphere located outside the event horizon and a shadow formed beyond it. These viable regions expand with increasing electric charge and increasing fR0, illustrating the interplay between gravitational and electromagnetic effects. By constraining the model using Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87*, we find that de Sitter black hole solutions remain compatible with the observational data, whereas anti-de Sitter solutions are disfavored for low electric charge and fR0 > -1. Finally, an analysis of the energy emission rate shows that higher electric charge enhances black hole evaporation, while stronger nonlinear electrodynamics effects and larger values of fR0 suppress it.

Abstract: Boson stars have been extensively studied in classical gravity, but their quantum properties remain comparatively unexplored. In this paper, we compute the quantum scalar fields and stress tensor in boson star spacetimes within the framework of semiclassical gravity. Divergences are regularized using Pauli-Villars fields, and accurate numerical results are obtained through spectral methods. Employing coherent states enables a direct comparison between the classical part of the stress tensor and the quantum fluctuation. Our results indicate that strong spacetime curvature is the primary source of large quantum effects. The renormalized quantum energy density is mostly positive but the radial pressure is negative, suggesting that classical boson star solutions require modification once quantum effects are included. Moreover, in regimes of large curvature, the quantum fluctuations can constitute a significant fraction of the total stress tensor. The methods developed here can be generalized to other compact objects and used to study their response to quantum corrections.

Abstract: The quantum-field-theoretic description for the U(1)-Goldstone boson of a scalar Bose-Einstein condensate with time-dependent contact interactions is developed beyond the acoustic approximation in accordance with Bogoliubov theory. The resulting effective action is mapped to a relativistic quantum field theory on a dispersive (or rainbow) cosmological spacetime which has a superluminal Corley-Jacobson dispersion relation. Time-dependent changes of the s-wave scattering length to quantum-simulate cosmological particle production are accompanied by a time-dependent healing length that can be interpreted as an analog Planck length in the comoving frame. Non-adiabatic transitions acquire a dispersive character, which is thoroughly discussed. The framework is applied to exponentially expanding or power-law contracting $(2+1)$-dimensional spacetimes which are known to produce scale-invariant cosmological power spectra. The sensitivity of these scenarios to the time-dependence of the Bogoliubov dispersion is investigated: We find a violation of scale-invariance via analytically trackable Transplanckian damping effects if the cut-off scale is not well separated from the horizon-crossing scale. In case of the exponential expansion, these damping effects remarkably settle and converge to another scale-invariant plateau in the far ultraviolet regime where non-adiabatic transitions are suppressed by the high dispersion. The developed framework enables quantitative access to more drastic analog cosmological scenarios with improved predictability in the ultraviolet regime that ultimately may lead to the observation of a scale-invariant cosmological power spectrum in the laboratory.

Abstract: We present new initial data codes for constructing stationary, axisymmetric equilibrium models of differentially rotating neutron stars in full general relativity within the Frankfurt University/KADATH (FUKA) suite of initial data codes. FUKA leverages the KADATH spectral library to solve the Einstein equations under the assumption of an isentropic fluid without magnetic fields while incorporating GRHayLEOS to support 3D tabulated equations of state in \textit{stellar collapse} format. The two solvers explored in this work include one using quasi-isotropic coordinates (QIC) in Spherical coordinates while the other solves the eXtended Conformal Thin Sandwich (XCTS) decomposition in Cartesian coordinates, enabling the construction of equilibrium configurations with high accuracy and efficiency. In this work we adopt the Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu differential rotation law, however, the code is designed to be extensible to other rotation laws, allowing for exploration of physically relevant sequences and critical rotation thresholds. Furthermore, we perform convergence tests demonstrating the exponential accuracy of the spectral approach, we validate QIC and XCTS solutions against models well-studied in the literature, and we also compare FUKA solutions against the well-known RNS code. Finally, we explore the impact that initial data resolution has on dynamical simulations and recover the convergence order of the evolution scheme, the dominate source of error in this study. The new FUKA codes and results presented here lay the foundation for future extensions to more general configurations, including magnetic fields, removal of isentropic assumptions, and binary systems, and have been made publicly available to support community efforts in modeling differentially rotating relativistic stars.

Abstract: In this manuscript we generalize Ref. [1] and derive a complete set of local consistency conditions for bulk fields in braneworld scenarios with an arbitrary number of dimensions. This provides the first fully local and dimension-independent generalization of all known criteria for bulk fields. Within this framework, we show that a free scalar field is consistent and localized, whereas minimally and non-minimally coupled Maxwell fields violate the conditions, leading to a no-go theorem valid in any dimension. For nonlinear electrodynamics, we find that only the model $L(F)=b\sqrt{F}$ admits a consistent and normalizable zero mode, and that among p-forms, consistency occurs solely for the free 0-form. We also demonstrate that Dirac fermions, with or without Yukawa terms, are inconsistent within this framework and therefore cannot propagate in the bulk. Our local approach makes explicit that these conclusions do not depend on any particular internal geometry or warp factor: previously known results arise merely as special cases of a broader and strictly local structure, highlighting the universality of the constraints derived here.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Inflation is a necessary cosmic mechanism to cure basic inconsistencies of the standard model of cosmology. These problems are usually `fixed' by postulating the existence of a scalar field (called the ``inflaton''). However, other less ad hoc options are possible. In the running vacuum model (RVM) framework, the vacuum energy density (VED) is a function of the Hubble rate $H$ and its time derivatives: $ρ_{\rm vac}=ρ_{\rm vac}(H, \dot{H},\ddot{H},\dots)$. In this context, the VED is dynamical (there is no rigid cosmological constant $Λ$). In the FLRW epoch, $ρ_{\rm vac}$ evolves very slowly with expansion, as befits the observed $Λ\simeq$const. behavior. In contrast, in the very early universe the vacuum fluctuations induce higher powers $H^N$ capable of unleashing fast inflation in a short period in which $H\simeq$ const. We call this mechanism `RVM-inflation'. It does not require an inflaton field since inflation is brought about by pure quantum field theory (QFT) effects on the dynamical background. It is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant. In this work, we study a closely related scenario: the decay of the exact de Sitter vacuum into FLRW spacetime in its radiation epoch and the subsequent impact on the current universe, and compare with the RVM. We find that in both cases inflation is driven by $H^4$ powers together with subleading contributions of order $H^2$ that ease a graceful-exit transition into the radiation-dominated epoch, where the FLRW regime starts and ultimately develops a mildly evolving VED in the late universe: $δρ_{\rm vac}\sim {\cal O}(m_{\rm Pl} ^2 H^2)$. The outcome is an unified QFT approach to inflation and dark energy (conceived as dynamical vacuum energy) with potentially measurable phenomenological consequences in the present universe which can help to cure the cosmological tensions.

Abstract: Synergies between self-force theory and other approaches to the gravitational two-body problem have traditionally relied on calculations of gauge-invariant observables as functions of orbital frequencies. However, in self-force theory one can also define a complete set of constants of motion: energy, azimuthal angular momentum, and radial and polar actions. Here we outline how directly utilizing these constants allows for more straightforward comparisons and hybridizations across the parameter space, as well as more streamlined waveform generation through flux-balance laws. Restricting to the case of nonspinning binaries and first order in self-force, we compute the constants of motion and the corrections to fundamental frequencies numerically as well as analytically (to 9PN in a post-Newtonian expansion), establishing consistency with the highest-order (4PN) results available from post-Newtonian theory. We also apply the results to identify the perturbed locations of special curves in the parameter space: circular orbits and the separatrix between bound and plunging orbits.

Abstract: Astronomy, often perceived as a distant or luxury science, holds immense potential as a driver for sustainable local socio-economic development. This paper explores how astronomy can create tangible benefits for communities through education, tourism, technology transfer, and capacity building. Using case studies from South Africa, Chile, Indonesia, and India, we demonstrate how astronomical facilities and initiatives have stimulated local economies, generated employment, supported small enterprises, and enhanced STEM participation, while simultaneously inspiring a sense of shared global heritage. The analysis identifies both successes and challenges, including unequal benefit distribution, limited local ownership, and sustainability gaps once external funding ends. Building on these lessons, we propose a practical framework/guidelines for designing, implementing, and evaluating astronomy-based community initiatives, rooted in participatory engagement and aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper positions astronomy as a catalyst for inclusive growth, demonstrating that investment in the cosmos can translate into grounded, measurable benefits for people and places on Earth.

Abstract: In-space manufacturing is essential for achieving long-term planetary colonization, particularly on Mars, where material transport from Earth is both costly and logistically restrictive. Traditional subtractive manufacturing methods are highly equipment-, energy-, and material-intensive, making additive manufacturing (AM) a more practical and sustainable alternative for extraterrestrial production. Among various AM technologies, selective laser melting (SLM) stands out due to its exceptional versatility, precision, and capability to produce dense metallic parts with complex geometries. However, conventional SLM processes rely heavily on inert argon environments to prevent oxidation and ensure high-quality part formation, conditions that are difficult to reproduce on Mars. This study investigates the feasibility of using carbon dioxide (CO2), which makes up over 95% of the Martian atmosphere, as a potential substitute for argon in SLM. Single-track and two-dimensional 316L stainless steel specimens were fabricated under argon, CO2, and ambient air environments with a wide range of laser parameters to evaluate the influence of atmospheric composition on surface morphology, microstructural cohesion, and oxidation behavior. The results reveal that no single parameter controls the overall part quality; rather, a balance of parameters is essential to maintain thermal equilibrium during fabrication. Although parts produced in CO2 exhibited slightly inferior surface finish, cohesion, and oxidation resistance compared to argon, they performed significantly better than those fabricated in ambient air. These findings suggest that CO2-assisted SLM could enable sustainable in situ manufacturing on Mars and may also serve as a cost-effective alternative shielding gas for terrestrial applications.

Abstract: We investigate the effect of charge migration and residual non-linearity on the JWST/NIRSpec G395H NRS1 and NRS2 detectors using Bright Object Time Series (BOTS) observations of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b. These full-orbit phase curve observations were taken over 37.8 hours (1.57 days), and provide an excellent testbed of the non-linearity behavior of NRS1 and NRS2 over long timescales. For both detectors, our analysis demonstrates charge losses at the center of the spectral trace and charge excesses at the trace edges. We find that the NRS1 detector displays ~3x larger deviations from linearity compared to NRS2. Given the large transit (~1.5%) and eclipse (~0.5%) signals for WASP-121b, we also investigate variations in the distribution of charge throughout the time-series observation. Our results show that charge distribution varies at different planetary orbital phases for NRS1, which manifests as a change in the morphology and shape of the spectral trace over the course of the time-series. The effect of charge distribution on the trace shape is not evident for NRS2.

Abstract: Binary black holes (BBHs) exhibiting spin-induced orbital precession offer unique insight into compact-binary formation channels, cosmology, and tests of general relativity. We conduct a dedicated search for precessing BBHs in Advanced LIGO's third observing run (O3) using the harmonic decomposition method of precessing waveforms. We introduce a novel scheme to reduce the number of filters in a harmonic search. With our new approach, our template bank requires $5\times$ fewer filters compared to another proposed precessing search in the same region. We do not find any new significant events. Our new search method achieves up to $\sim 28\%$ improvement in sensitivity and up to $5\times$ lower computational costs compared to existing precessing search pipelines. Our method enables scalable, sensitive searches for precessing BBHs in future gravitational-wave observing runs.

Abstract: The field of time-domain astronomy has experienced unprecedented growth due to the increasing deployment of robotic telescopes capable of autonomous, round-the-clock sky monitoring. These instruments have revolutionized the detection and characterization of transient phenomena such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, variable stars, and gravitational wave counterparts. This paper explores the transformative role of robotic telescopes such as ZTF, ATLAS, and LCOGT in enabling rapid-response observations and building large time-series datasets. We review the design principles and scheduling algorithms behind robotic observatories and assess their scientific contributions across different wavelength regimes. Particular attention is given to the synergy between robotic systems and machine learning pipelines that enable real-time classification of transient events. We also discuss challenges such as data deluge, follow-up prioritization, and observational biases, as well as future directions in global telescope networks

Abstract: Multiple-frequency periodograms -- based on time series models consisting of two or more independent sinusoids -- have long been discussed. What is new here is the presentation of a practical, simple-to-use computational framework implementing this concept. Our algorithms have super resolution that evades the Rayleigh criterion, as well as provision for statistical weighting and tapering. They can be used for essentially any time series (e.g. time-tagged events or point measurements) with arbitrary sampling -- even or uneven. Examples of super resolution of synthetic data, sunspot numbers, and the rich pulsations of white dwarf J0135+5722, demonstrate practical applications. Appendices derive generalized periodograms using an arbitrary number of arbitrary basis functions (following Bretthorst, 1988)and define several examples of non-sinusoidal bases for these ``omnigrams.'' Application beyond the frequency domain is demonstrated with an autoregressive model exhibiting super resolution in the time domain. A GitHub repository containing omnigram code, and symbolic algebra scripts for generating it, will soon be available.

Machine learning (ML) methods offer an efficient, probabilistic approach to classify them, which can be useful for making discoveries and conducting deeper studies. In earlier work, we applied the LightGBM (ML model) to classify 277,069 {\em Chandra} point sources into eight categories: active galactic nuclei (AGN), X-ray emitting stars, young stellar objects (YSO), high-mass X-ray binaries, low-mass X-ray binaries, ultraluminous X-ray sources, cataclysmic variables, and pulsars. In this work, we present the classification table of 54,770 robustly classified sources (over $3σ$ confidence), including 14,066 sources at $>4σ$ significance. To ensure classification reliability and gain a deeper insight, we investigate the multiwavelength feature relationships learned by the LightGBM model, focusing on AGNs, Stars, and YSOs. We employ Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to quantify the contribution of individual features and their interactions to the predicted classification probabilities.
  Among other things, we find infrared-optical and X-ray decision boundaries for separating AGN/Stars, and infrared-X-ray boundaries for YSOs. These results are crucial for estimating object classes even with limited multiwavelength data. This study represents one of the earliest applications of XAI to large-scale astronomical datasets, demonstrating ML models' potential for uncovering physically meaningful patterns in data in addition to classification. Finally, our publicly available, extensive, and interactive catalogue will be helpful to explore the contributions of features and their combinations in greater detail in the future.

Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) is a well-motivated extension of cold dark matter that can modify halo structure on galactic and group scales while remaining consistent with large-scale structure. However, practical SIDM work often requires bridging several layers, including microphysical scattering models, velocity-dependent effective cross sections, phenomenological astrophysical constraints, and (separately) data-driven halo fits, such as rotation curves. In this paper, we describe \texttt{sidmkit}, a transparent and reproducible Python package designed to support SIDM ``micro$\rightarrow$macro'' calculations and to provide a robust batch pipeline for fitting rotation curves in the SPARC data. On the SIDM side, \texttt{sidmkit} implements velocity-dependent momentum-transfer cross sections for a Yukawa interaction using standard analytic approximations (Born, classical, and Hulthén-based) with a numerical partial-wave option for spot checks. It also provides consistent velocity-moment averaging for Maxwellian relative speeds, scattering-rate utilities, and curated literature \emph{summary} constraints for regression tests and exploratory scans. On the rotation-curve side, we implement bounded non-linear least squares fits of NFW and Burkert halo models to SPARC baryonic decompositions, with optional mass-to-light priors and information-criterion summaries (AIC/BIC). For the demonstration dataset, we process 191 \texttt{rotmod} galaxies (LTG+ETG bundles) and fit both NFW and Burkert models (382 total fits). We find that Burkert is preferred by $Δ\mathrm{BIC} > 0$ for $65.4\%$ of galaxies, with ``strong'' preference ($Δ\mathrm{BIC}>6$) in $32.5\%$ of galaxies;

Abstract: The search for the sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) using high-energy neutrinos represents a frontier in high-energy astrophysics. However, a critical bottleneck remains: the ability to rapidly survey the sizable sky areas defined by the localization uncertainties of neutrino detectors and to provide rapid spectroscopic classification of the multitude of optical transients found within them.
  By deploying a large field-of-view with high-multiplex Multi-Object Spectroscopy (MOS) on a large aperture telescope, one can instantaneously cover neutrino error circles, thus providing crucial spectroscopic classifications of potential counterparts discovered, for example, by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (LSST) with unprecedented efficiency. Furthermore, simultaneous operation of a giant panoramic central Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) would allow for detailed kinematic and environmental characterization of primary candidates. This facility would unlock deep synergies between next-generation neutrino telescopes (IceCube-Gen2, KM3NeT) and gamma-ray observatories (CTAO), transforming unique multi-messenger alerts into a comprehensive physical understanding.

Abstract: The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will carry out a wide-field imaging and slitless spectroscopic survey of Type Ia Supernovae to improve our understanding of dark energy. Crucial to this endeavor is obtaining supernova spectra uncontaminated by light from their host galaxies. However, obtaining such spectra is made more difficult by the inherent problem in wide-field slitless spectroscopic surveys: the blending of spectra of close objects. The spectrum of a supernova will blend with the host galaxy, even from regions distant from the supernova on the sky. If not properly removed, this contamination will introduce systematic bias when the supernova spectra are later used to determine intrinsic supernova parameters and to infer the parameters of dark energy. To address this problem we developed an algorithm that makes use of the spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy at all available observatory roll angles to reconstruct a three-dimensional (3d; 2d spatial, 1d spectral) representation of the underlying host galaxy that accurately matches the 2d slitless spectrum of the host galaxy when projected to an arbitrary rotation angle. We call this ``scene reconstruction''. The projection of the reconstructed scene can be subtracted from an observation of a supernova to remove the contamination from the underlying host. Using simulated Roman data, we show that our method has extremely small systematic errors and significantly less random noise than if we subtracted a single perfectly aligned spectrum of the host obtained before or after the supernova was visible.

Abstract: We propose a new Bayesian framework to infer the neutron star equation of state (EOS) from mass and radius observations and neutron matter theory by defining priors that directly parameterize mass-radius space instead of pressure-energy density space. We use direct and accurate inversion approximations to map mass-radius relations to the underlying EOS. We systematically compare its EOS inferences with those inferred from traditional EOS parameterizations, taking care to quantify the systematic prior uncertainties of both. Our results show that prior uncertainties should be included in all Bayesian approaches. The more natural alternative framework provides broader coverage of the physically allowed mass-radius space, especially small radius configurations, and yields enhanced computational efficiency and substantially reduced dependence on prior choices. Our results demonstrate that direct parameterization in observed space offers a robust and efficient alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: We present a five-year X-ray spectral and timing analysis of the optically selected Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) AT2019teq, which displays extreme variability, including order-of-magnitude changes in flux on minute-to-day timescales, and a rare late-time emergence of hard X-ray emission leading to the longest-lived corona in a known TDE. In one epoch, we detect sub-mHz quasi-periodic oscillations with significance tested via MCMC-based red-noise simulations (p $\leq 0.03$). AT2019teq exhibits a clear spectral evolution from a soft (blackbody-dominated) state to a hard (power-law-dominated) state, with a late-time radio brightening that may be associated with the state transition. We identify similarities between AT2019teq's evolution and X-ray binary soft-to-hard state transitions, albeit at higher luminosity and much faster timescales. We use the presence of both a disk-dominated and a corona-dominated state to apply multiple mass estimators from X-ray spectral and variability properties. These techniques are mutually consistent within $2σ$ and systematically yield a lower black hole mass ($\log(M_{BH}/M_{\odot}) = 5.67 \pm 0.09$) than inferred from host galaxy scaling ($\log(M_{BH}/M_{\odot})=6.14 \pm 0.19$).

Abstract: The Fermi and eROSITA bubbles in the Milky Way represent an archetypal case of galactic nucleus feedback, yet their origin remains highly debated. Here we use hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the formation of the "Fermi bubbles" in the nearby Circinus galaxy, a pair of kpc-scaled elliptical bubbles seen in both radio and X-ray observations. We find that a pair of active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets drive forward shocks in the circumgalactic medium, and after evolving for ~0.95 Myr, the shock-delineated bubble pair roughly matches the observed Circinus bubbles in size and morphology. Our mock X-ray image and spectrum reproduce the observed edge-brightened X-ray surface brightness distribution and spectrum quite well, and suggest that non-thermal emissions from the jet ejecta also contribute substantially to radio and X-ray emissions from the inner "hotspot" region. We further show that AGN winds tend to produce more spherical bubbles with a wider base near the galactic plane, inconsistent with observations. The hotspot emissions and the misalignment between the galaxy rotational axis and the bubble's axis argue against a starburst wind origin. Our study thus corroborates the AGN jet-shock model for the origin of both the Circinus bubbles and the Fermi bubbles, and suggests that AGN jet feedback may be a common origin of extended gaseous bubbles in regular disk galaxies, potentially playing an important role in their evolution.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of the evolution of low- and intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (L/IMXBs) consisting of a $1.4\,M_{\odot}$ neutron star (NS) and a donor star of mass $1-8\,M_{\odot}$. Using grids of detailed MESA simulations, we show that for donor masses of $2-8\,M_{\odot}$, mass transfer may be dynamically unstable, leading to a common envelope (CE) phase. By adopting CE ejection efficiencies in the range $α_{\rm CE} = 0.3-3.0$, we find that post-CE binaries frequently experience a CE decoupling phase (CEDP), which plays a critical role in determining their final orbital and compositional properties. Systems with initial donor masses $\gtrsim 3.5\,M_{\odot}$ predominantly evolve into NS binaries with carbon-oxygen or oxygen-neon white dwarfs (WDs) with masses between $0.5\,M_{\odot}$ and $1.4\,M_{\odot}$. Comparison with the observed population of binary pulsars with a WD companion shows better agreement with higher CE ejection efficiencies ($α_{\rm CE} = 3.0$). Furthermore, we demonstrate that NSs can accrete a sufficient amount of matter ($\gtrsim 0.01\,M_{\odot}$) during the CEDP and subsequent Case BA/BB/BC mass transfer phases to be effectively recycled into millisecond pulsars. We identify two distinct evolutionary channels capable of reproducing the observed characteristics of the millisecond pulsar PSR J1928+1815 with a helium-star companion. Our results highlight the importance of the CEDP in the formation of recycled pulsars and provide constraints on the CE ejection efficiency during binary evolution.

Abstract: Tidal disruption event (TDE) light curves are increasingly used to infer the masses of quiescent supermassive black holes ($M_{\rm{BH}}$), offering a powerful probe of low-mass black hole demographics independent of host-galaxy scaling relations. However, the reliability of most semi-analytic TDE models assume full stellar disruption, despite theoretical expectations that partial disruptions dominate the TDE population. In this work we test the robustness of current TDE models using three repeating partial TDEs (rpTDEs), in which the multiple flares produced by the same surviving stellar core must yield consistent black hole masses. We present spectroscopic observations establishing AT 2023adr as a rpTDE, making it the third such spectroscopically confirmed event. We independently model the flares of the three rpTDEs; 2020vdq, 2022dbl, and 2023adr, applying fallback-accretion fits, stream-stream collision scaling relations, luminosity-based empirical relations, and cooling-envelope fits. After accounting for statistical and model-specific systematics, we find that all TDE models generally return self-consistent $M_{\rm{BH}}$ values between flares, and are broadly consistent with host-galaxy $M_{\rm{BH}}$ proxies, recovering $M_{\rm{BH}}$ to within 0.3-0.5 dex. However, the convergence of fallback models towards unphysical stellar masses and impact parameters reveals limitations in the existing fallback model grids. We also show that light curve coverage, particularly in the near-UV, is critical for constraining model parameters. This has direct implications for interpreting the thousands of TDE light curves expected from upcoming surveys such as the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, where from simulations, we find that $M_{\rm{BH}}$ may be underestimated on average by 0.5 dex without additional follow-up.

Abstract: Nuclear yields are powerful probes of supernova explosions, their engines and their progenitors. In addition, as we improve our understanding of these explosions, we can use nuclear yields to probe dense matter and neutrino physics, both of which play a critical role in the central supernova engine. Especially with upcoming gamma-ray detectors that can directly detect radioactive isotopes out to increasing distances from gamma-rays emitted during their decay, nuclear yields have the potential to provide some of the most direct probes of supernova engines and stellar burning. To utilize these probes, we must understand and limit the uncertainties in their production. Uncertainties in the nuclear physics can be minimized by combining both laboratory experiments and nuclear theory. Similarly, astrophysical uncertainties caused by simplified explosion trajectories can be minimized by higher-fidelity stellar-evolution and supernova-engine models. This paper reviews the physics and astrophysics uncertainties in modeling nucleosynthetic yields, identifying the key areas of study needed to maximize the potential of supernova yields as probes of astrophysical transients and dense-matter physics.

Abstract: The jet compositions of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are very important to understand the energy dissipation and radiation mechanisms, but it remains an open question in GRB physics. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis to search for 88 bright GRBs that include a total of 129 pulses observed by Fermi/GBM with redshift measured, and extract the spectra of each pulse with Band function (Band), cutoff power-law (CPL), blackbody (BB), non-dissipative photospheric (NDP), Band+BB, as well as CPL+BB. We find that 80 pulses, 35 pulses, and 14 pulses present purely non-thermal, hybrid, and thermal spectra, respectively. By focusing on those 80 pulses with purely non-thermal spectra, one can estimate the lower limits of magnetization factor ($σ$) via suppressing the pseudo-thermal component. It is found that 30 pulses in 21 GRBs are the lower limit of $σ>5$ at the photosphere by adopting $R_{0}=10^{10}$ cm. It suggests that at least the outflow of those GRB jets with high $σ$ is dominated by Poynting-flux. On the other hand, we also perform the light curve fitting with a fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED) model for 15 bright GRBs with a high magnetization factor in our sample, and find that a correlation between pulse width ($w$) and energy of 13 GRBs really exists in their energy-resolved light curves. It is also a piece of independent evidence for those GRBs with a high value $σ$ to support the origin of the Poynting flux outflow.

Abstract: We present the UV/X-ray joint spectral analyses of four Seyfert~1 galaxies (PG 0804+761, NGC 7469, SWIFT J1921.1-5842, and SWIFT J1835.0+3240) using the data acquired with the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope and Soft X-ray Telescope onboard AstroSat. We model the intrinsic UV/X-ray continuum with the accretion disk, warm and hot Comptonization using the OPTXAGNF and FAGNSED models, where the disk seed photons are Comptonized in the warm and hot corona. The Eddington ratio of the four Seyferts ranges from 0.01 to 1. In the case of SWIFT J1835.0$+$3240, we infer a compact warm corona ($ R_{warm} - R_{hot} \lesssim 18 r_{g}$) while, PG 0804+761, NGC 7469, and SWIFT J1921.1-5842 may exhibit a larger warm Comptonizing region ($\gtrsim 32r_{g}$). We could constrain the spin parameter in PG 0804+761, $a^{\star} = 0.76_{-0.20}^{+0.08}$ (1$σ$ error), with the FAGNSED model. In SWIFT J1835.0+3240 and SWIFT J1921.1-5842, the UV/X-ray spectral variability may be driven by the thermal Comptonization of the disk seed photons in the hot corona. Furthermore, the observed spectral hardening with the decrease in disk temperature and accretion rate compared to earlier observations may indicate a state transition in SWIFT J1835.0+3240 from a high/soft to a low/hard state.

Abstract: Abell 3571 is a nearby, X-ray bright galaxy cluster located in the Shapley Supercluster. Although it appears morphologically relaxed in X-ray images, multiwavelength observations reveal subtle indications of residual dynamical activity, likely associated with past merger events. Using wide-field ($1^{\circ} \times 1^{\circ}$) data from the Einstein Probe Follow-up X-ray Telescope (EP-FXT), we extend measurements of the cluster's properties beyond its $R_{500}$ radius. We detect surface-brightness excesses on both the northern and southern sides, consistent with previous XMM-Newton results. The temperature, pressure, and entropy in the northern excess region are lower than the average values, whereas those on the southern side are slightly higher. However, we find no evidence for cold fronts or shocks. These features can be interpreted as sloshing motions triggered by an off-center minor merger. Our findings suggest that, despite its symmetric appearance, A3571 is still recovering from a minor merger and is currently in a post-merger phase. This work also demonstrates the excellent capability of EP-FXT for probing the outskirts of galaxy clusters.

Abstract: We investigated the long-term evolution of the cyclotron line energy, as well as the relationship between cyclotron line energy and luminosity in the high-mass X-ray binary Vela X-1, based on archival Swift/BAT monitoring from 2005 to 2024 and pulse-to-pulse analysis of nine NuSTAR observations from 2012 to 2024. Our results provide the first confirmation that the long-term decay of the harmonic line energy ($E_{\rm cyc,H}$) in Vela X-1 has ended. We further report the first detection of a transient increase in $E_{\rm cyc,H}$ between 2020 and 2023, which suggests a sudden and significant change in the magnetic field configuration or accretion geometry. In addition, $E_{\rm cyc,H}$ shows slightly lower values at low luminosities and tends to flatten at higher luminosities, in the range of $(0.13\text{--}1.21) \times10^{37} $erg $\rm{s}^{-1}$. The fundamental line energy ($E_{\rm cyc,F}$) exhibits no significant variation with time or luminosity, remaining stable at approximately 25 keV.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: When a stellar binary encounters a spinning black hole, interesting phenomena might result due to the mutual interaction between the binary spin, orbital angular momentum and the black hole spin. Here we consider such encounters between an intermediate mass spinning black hole and a close identical white dwarf binary system whose center of mass follows a parabolic trajectory. After studying a corresponding three-body problem in the point particle approximation, we perform a suite of smoothed particle hydrodynamics based numerical simulations of such scenarios. For this, we integrate the geodesic equations for the spinning black hole, while considering the hydrodynamics and the self and mutual gravitational interactions of the stars in a Newtonian approximation, an approach justified by the choice of parameters in the theory. We consider various initial configurations of the binary center of mass leading to equatorial and off-equatorial orbits, as also various initial inclinations between the binary's initial spin angular momentum and its initial orbital angular momentum. We find that the effects of black hole spin manifest clearly in the tidal dynamics of the binary components, while the observables of tidal encounters such as mass fallback rates are strongly dependent on the initial inclination angle. We show that the influence of the black hole spin emerges in distinct ways for different initial configurations of the binary's spin alignment. We establish that within the ambits of the Hills mechanism, in certain cases, the fallback rate may show a three-hump structure, due to interactions between tidal debris of the individual stars.

Abstract: While the temporal variations of the spectro-polarimetric nature of pulsars remains unexplored, this investigation offers significant potential for uncovering key insights into pulsar emission mechanisms, magnetic field geometry, and propagation effects within the magnetosphere. We developed a package for investigating time-varying spectral behavior for full Stokes parameters and demonstrate it on a millisecond pulsar (MSP) J2144-5237 in a binary system (orbital period ~10 days) using the Parkes UWL receiver. In this study we report rotation measure (RM) variation with orbital phase. We find that the temporal variations in the spectra of Stokes I, Q, and V are generally correlated throughout the orbit, while Stokes U exhibits intervals of both correlation and anticorrelation with Stokes I, depending on the orbital phase. We also provide a Poincare sphere representation of the polarization properties of J2144-5237, demonstrating a systematic temporal change of Poincare sphere location for the main component with orbital phase. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of time-varying properties of the spectro-polarimetric nature of any pulsars or MSPs. Extending this study to probe the spectro-temporal nature of full Stokes data on a larger sample of MSPs or pulsars has the potential to provide vital information on emission mechanisms inside the magnetosphere, interstellar propagation effects, and binary interactions.

Abstract: I suggest that some of the mysterious temporal properties of Fast Radio Bursts (FRB) may be explained if they are produced by dynamically triaxial magnetars. If the bursts are narrowly collimated along open field lines, then observed repeating FRB may be those in which the moment of inertia tensor is only slightly triaxial and the rotation axis, open field lines and radiation point nearly to the observer. Apparently non-repeating FRB may be triaxial with the direction of open field lines and radiation wandering across the sky, reducing their duty factors by several orders of magnitude. A slightly triaxial moment tensor in repeaters moves the line of sight into or out of the radiation pattern or within it, explaining periods of greater or lesser (or absent) activity, and making the probability of detecting a burst vary aperiodically. The dynamics of triaxial bodies may also thwart the coherent integration of gravitational signals from fast-rotating accreting neutron stars.

Abstract: The nature of the remnant of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger is uncertain. Though certainly a black hole (BH) in the cases of the most massive BNSs, X-ray lightcurves from gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows suggest a neutron star (NS) as a viable candidate for both the merger remnant as well as the central engine of these transients. When jointly observed with gravitational waves (GWs), X-ray lightcurves from BNS merger events could provide critical constraints on the remnant's nature. We aim to assess the current and future capabilities to detect a NS remnant through X-ray observations following GW detections. To this end, we simulate GW signals from BNS mergers and the subsequent X-ray emission from newborn millisecond magnetars. The GW detectability is modeled for both current and next-generation interferometers, while the X-ray emission is reproduced using a dedicated numerical code that models magnetar spin-down and ejecta dynamics informed by numerical-relativity simulations. In our simulations, 2% - 16% of BNS mergers form millisecond magnetars. Among these, up to 70% could be detectable, amounting to up to 1 millisecond magnetar detection per year with SVOM/MXT-like instruments during the LIGO Virgo KAGRA LIGO India (LVKI) O5 run, with optimal detectability occurring about 2 hours post-merger. For next-generation GW interferometers, this rate could increase by up to three orders of magnitude, with peak detectability 3 to 4 hours post-merger. We also explore how the magnetar's magnetic field strength and observer viewing angle affect detectability and discuss optimized observational strategies. Although more likely with upcoming GW interferometers, detecting the spin-down emission of a millisecond magnetar may already be within reach, warranting sustained theoretical and observational efforts given the profound implications for mergers, GRBs, and NS physics of a single detection.

Abstract: The launch of relativistic jets of plasma on astrophysical to cosmological scales are observed in a variety of astrophysical sources, from active galactic nuclei to X-rays binaries. While these jets can be reproduced by the general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) and particle-in-cells (GRPIC) simulations of the dynamical Kerr magnetosphere, the development of analytic models to describe the physics of the jets has remained limited. A key challenge is to analytically describe the individual trajectories of accelerated charged particles which ultimately build up the jet and emit radiation. In this work, we provide a first simple but fully analytical model of jet launching from the Kerr magnetosphere based on the motion of charged particles. To that end, we use the integrability of electrogeodesic motion in the Kerr monopole magnetosphere to study the ejection of charged particles near the poles. This enables us to derive (i) a criterion for the rotation axis to constitute a stable latitunal equilibrium position, thereby representing an idealized jet, (ii) the expression for the magnetic frame-dragging effect, and (iii) the condition for an asymptotic observer to measure blueshifted particles emanating from the black hole surroundings. Our study reveals that particles can be accelerated only in a specific region whose maximal radius depends on the spin and magnetization of the black hole. Alongside these results, we provide a detailed review of the construction of test magnetospheres from (explicit and hidden) symmetries of the Kerr geometry and the condition for the separability of the electrogeodesic motion in a test magnetosphere, which serves as a basis for the model we study in this work.

Abstract: Radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) determines the bulk evolution and observable emission in a wide variety of high-energy astrophysical phenomena. Due to their complexity, RHD problems must usually be studied through numerical simulation. We have extended the publicly available RICH code, which previously solved the equations of RHD in the limit of grey flux-limited diffusion (FLD), to operate with a multigroup FLD solver. RICH is a semi-Lagrangian code that solves the equations of RHD on an unstructured moving mesh, and is the first multigroup RHD moving mesh code, making it uniquely applicable to problems with extreme dynamic range and dynamically important radiation forces. We validate our multigroup module against multiple analytic benchmarks, including a novel test of the RHD Doppler term. The computational efficiency of the code is aided by a novel scheme to accelerate convergence in optically thick cells. Finally, we apply multigroup RICH in a pilot study of a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE), using a $10^4 M_\odot$ intermediate-mass black hole. Our simulations self-consistently produce a bright early-time X-ray flash prior to peak optical/UV light, in qualitative agreement with post-processing of (grey) RICH simulations of supermassive black hole TDEs, as well as X-ray observations of the TDE AT 2022dsb.
