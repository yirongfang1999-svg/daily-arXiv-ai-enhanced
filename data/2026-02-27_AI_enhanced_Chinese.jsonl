However, like other software suites in astronomy its comprehensive syntax creates a significant learning curve to new users. To address this, we present STILTS-NLI, a natural language interface that generates STILTS commands from user prompts, with agentic support for a user-friendly experience. We developed STILTS-NLI by fine-tuning a compact, open-source Large Language Model (LLM) on a synthetically generated dataset. This dataset was curated and validated to ensure both comprehensive coverage of key STILTS functionalities and the syntactic correctness of the resulting commands. Our results demonstrate that this specialised model generates valid commands that match and in some cases outperform larger proprietary models. By leveraging small, open-source models, STILTS-NLI provides an accessible, low-resource solution that lowers the barrier to entry for using STILTS.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We present a self-calibration method based on Zernike polynomials, applied to imaging data from the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST). Our approach constructs a global geometric distortion (GD) model from the position offsets of stars in the WFST r-band relative to Gaia DR3, achieving a median systematic uncertainty of below 10 mas for individual exposures. The correspondence between Zernike polynomials and optical aberrations reveals that the global GD of WFST is dominated by coma, inherent to the optical design, while rapid variations are likely attributed to the atmospheric dispersion corrector. Applying this method to 82 exposures from a single night (20250218), we find that the relative positions of the WFST CCDs remain stable, with standard deviations of less than 0.1 pixel in translation and 1.8 arcsec in rotation. The corrected WFST astrometric system is thereby tied to the Gaia DR3 coordinate frame, with further refinements to be presented in future work.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work we demonstrate single-photon counting with superconducting Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors at the wavelengths 3.8, 8.5, 18.5, and 25 $\u03bc$m and measure resolving powers ($E/\u03b4E$) of 9.9, 5.9, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively, with corresponding dark count rates of 4, 8, 34, and 48 mHz. Our membrane-based devices reach phonon-loss limited performance at 3.8 $\u03bc$m, more than doubling the performance attainable with comparable solid-substrate devices. These results showcase the detector technology in the mid-infrared and the intricate measurement setup required for these sensitive detectors.

The PIAACMC has been shown to closely approach the theoretical limit for coronagraphic throughput but its performance has not been fully characterised on-sky. This study serves as the first on-sky characterisation of contrast and IWA performance of the PIAACMC and its first technological demonstration at sub-micron wavelengths. We designed and manufactured phase-shifting focal plane masks optimised for two cases, a narrowband 875 filter (875nm, 3% band) and a broadband z' filter (908nm, 14% band). We tested the coronagraphs both with an internal source and on-sky using MagAOX, the extreme adaptive optics instrument for the Magellan Clay 6.5 m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. We show good recovery of the off-axis light's PSF shape within 92% and 97% depending on the separation when aligning the inverse set of PIAA lenses. We demonstrate sub-lambda/D IWAs of about 0.74 lambda/D in 875 and 0.76 lambda/D in z'. We reach average raw contrasts within 1 and 5 lambda/D with the internal source of about 1.6e-3 in 875 and 1.3e-3 in z'.

We also show on-sky average raw contrasts within 1 and 5 lambda/D of about 1.4e-2 in 875 and 7.8e-3 in z'. These are likely limited by wavefront control, low-order aberrations, and poor observing conditions. Future work will improve the design and manufacturing processes of the focal plane masks to improve robustness and reach deeper contrast, as well as integrate focal plane wavefront control for non-common path aberrations correction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In force-free magnetospheres, charges are constrained to move along magnetic field lines and experience zero Lorentz force, due to the everywhere perpendicular orientation of electric and magnetic fields. However, a general angle-preserving conformal mapping of force-free fields does not necessarily produce another physically admissible force-free configuration when sources are present. In this work, we demonstrate that such invariance can nevertheless arise for certain choices of the free functions. Specifically, the governing stream equation is shown to be invariant under M\u00f6bius transformations.

While Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles guide the eventual public dissemination of data, traditional security methods for restricted phases often lack granularity or incur prohibitive performance penalties. To address this, we present a framework that integrates a flexible policy engine for fine-grained access control with a novel GPU-accelerated implementation of the AES-GCM authenticated encryption protocol.\n  The novelty of this work lies in the adaptation and optimization of a parallel tree-reduction strategy to overcome the main performance bottleneck in authenticated encryption on GPUs: the inherently sequential Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) authentication hash (GHASH). We present both the algorithmic adaptation and its efficient execution on GPU architectures. Although similar parallelization techniques have been explored in cryptographic research, this is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of their integration into a high-throughput encryption framework specifically designed for large-scale astronomical data. Our implementation transforms the sequential GHASH computation into a highly parallelizable, logarithmic-time process, achieving authenticated encryption throughput suitable for petabyte-scale image analysis.\n  Our solution provides a robust mechanism for data providers to enforce access policies, ensuring both confidentiality and integrity without hindering research workflows, thereby facilitating a secure and managed transition of data to public, FAIR archives.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

An additional soft component originating from a more extended region has been reported in few CVs. In a short Chandra exposure, we identified a tentative X-ray eclipse in UU Aqr, a non-magnetic CV which shows deep optical eclipses. Using observations with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and the XMM-Newton, we detect total eclipses in the orbital intensity profiles of this system in the hard X-ray band (3-10 keV with XMM and 3-25 keV with NuSTAR). However, the soft X-ray band (0.3-2.0 keV) shows no evidence of an eclipse. Detailed eclipse modeling, energy-resolved power spectral analysis and broadband spectral modeling indicate that the hard absorbed X-ray emission originates from a compact region near the WD, such as a boundary layer, while the soft, unabsorbed and un-eclipsed X-ray emission originates in an extended region. Neither scattering of hard X-rays nor colliding winds can account for the observed un-eclipsed soft emission. We instead propose that this component is produced by shocks within vertically extended, radiatively driven accretion-disk winds.
