By deriving the event horizon from the lapse function, we demonstrate that both the string cloud parameter and the electromagnetic background parameter significantly modify the horizon radius compared to the Schwarzschild case. Consequently, thermodynamic quantities-including the Hawking temperature, Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and heat capacity-become explicit functions of these additional parameters, with the heat capacity exhibiting divergences that signal phase transitions. We analyze the motion of massive test particles in this spacetime, deriving the effective potential and calculating the innermost stable circular orbit radius, which governs the inner edge of accretion disks and influences orbital stability. Scalar perturbations are examined through the associated effective potential, and quasinormal mode frequencies are computed using the sixth-order WKB approximation; the negative imaginary parts confirm the stability of the black hole under such perturbations. We also study the photon sphere structure, black hole shadow radius, and photon trajectories, showing how the interplay between string clouds and the electromagnetic background shapes the optical properties of this spacetime. Finally, we investigate weak gravitational lensing phenomena by deriving the deflection angle for both massive particles and photons using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem applied to the optical geometry. The results exhibit notable deviations from the Schwarzschild geometry, with the string cloud enhancing the deflection through a $(1-α)^{-1}$ factor while the electromagnetic parameter introduces competing corrections at second order."}

The parameter space regions that satisfy the energy extraction condition, as well as the efficiency and power of the extracted energy, are analyzed. The study shows that the presence of a negative cosmological constant extends the range of dominant reconnection radial locations where the energy extraction condition is met, and enables energy extraction even from black holes with relatively low spin. Furthermore, the influence of the negative cosmological constant on energy extraction is modulated by the extent of the dominant reconnection radial region: a more negative cosmological constant enhances the extracted energy, efficiency, and power, particularly for smaller dominant reconnection radii. These results demonstrate that the energy extraction from Kerr-AdS black holes is more favorable than that from their asymptotically flat counterparts. Our results highlight the crucial role of the cosmological constant in energy extraction via magnetic reconnection."}

If the shock upstream is optically thick, radiation smoothens the velocity discontinuity at the shock (radiation-mediated shocks). However, in mildly magnetized outflows, a collisionless subshock can form, enhancing the efficiency of particle acceleration. We solve the hydrodynamic equations of a steady-state, radiation-mediated shock together with the radiative transfer equations accounting for electron and proton acceleration. Our goal is to explore the impact of the magnetic field and non-thermal radiation on the shock structure and the resulting spectral distribution of photons. To this purpose, we assume a relativistic upstream fluid velocity ($Γ_u = 10$) and investigate shock configurations with variable upstream magnetization ($σ_u = 0$, $10^{-8}$, $10^{-4}$, $0.1$, and $0.3$). We find that synchrotron self-absorption alters the shock profile for $σ_u \\gtrsim 10^{-8}$, with resulting changes up to $100\\%$ in the bulk Lorentz factor at the shock; for $σ_u \\gtrsim 0.1$, a prominent subshock forms. The spectral energy distributions of upstream- and downstream-going photons are also altered. Radiative processes linked to accelerated protons are responsible for a high-energy ($\\gtrsim 10$ GeV) tail in the photon spectrum; however, the radiation flux and pressure are negligibly affected with consequent minor impact on the shock structure. Our work highlights the importance of coupling the shock hydrodynamics to the transport of photons, electrons, protons, and intermediate particles to forecast the multi-messenger emission from astrophysical transients."}

In addition to the well-known asymptotic quantities such as the Bondi-Sachs energy-momentum, the BMS charges and NP constants of this spacetime are computed. Explicit calculations of the latter are relatively scarce in the literature. Moreover, it has been proven that the NP constants of asymptotically flat, stationary, vacuum, and algebraically special spacetimes vanish (for instance, those of the Kerr spacetime). A by-product of the present analysis is to show that the algebraically special condition in the aforementioned result appears to be crucial, since the q-metric provides a counterexample to the conjecture that all asymptotically flat, stationary, vacuum, and asymptotically algebraically special spacetimes (a weaker version of the algebraically special condition) have vanishing NP constants."}

Here, we introduce, for the first time, cross sections for proton impact on H$_2$, calculated using the semi-classical implementation of the molecular convergent close-coupling method. Our findings show that proton-induced H$_2$ excitation is comparable in magnitude to that caused by electrons.

We find that scalar hair modestly alters the inflow and magnetic-field structure but strengthens gravitational redshift, markedly reducing the total flux and lensed ring brightness through relativistic transfer and spectral-shift effects. Moreover, we highlight a previously unexplored channel: the maximum interferometric diameter of the first photon ring responds strongly to the hair parameter but shows little dependence on accretion-flow details, making it a promising observable for constraining black-hole hair with future space-based interferometry."}

The evolution and properties of two type Ia supernovae in the Virgo cluster", "comment": "24 pages, 21 figures, 7 tables. Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are among the most precise cosmological distance indicators used to study the expansion history of the Universe. The vast increase of SN Ia data due to large-scale astrophysical surveys has led to the discovery of a wide variety of SN Ia sub-classes, such as transitional and fast-declining SNe Ia. However, their distinct photometric and spectroscopic properties differentiate them from the population of normal SNe Ia such that their use as cosmological tools remains challenged. Here, we present a high-cadenced photometric and spectroscopic dataset of two SNe Ia, SNe 2020ue and 2020nlb, which were discovered in the nearby Virgo cluster of galaxies. Our study shows that SN 2020nlb is a normal SN Ia whose unusually red color is intrinsic, arising from a lower photospheric temperature rather than interstellar reddening, providing clear evidence that color diversity among normal SNe Ia can have a physical origin. In contrast, SN 2020ue has photometric properties, such as color evolution and light-curve decay rate, similar to those of transitional SNe, spectroscopically it is more aligned with normal SNe Ia. This is evident from spectroscopic indicators such as the pseudo-equivalent width of \\ion{Si}{II} lines. Thus, such SNe Ia that are photometrically at the edge of the standard normal SNe Ia range may be missed in cosmological SNe Ia samples. Our results highlight that spectroscopic analysis of SNe Ia around peak brightness is crucial for identifying intrinsic color variations and constructing a more complete and physically homogeneous SN Ia sample for precision cosmology."}

The results show that, although all three non-singular cosmologies share identical late-time behavior and allow for a natural embedding of inflation in the scalar-field setting, they exhibit qualitatively distinct non-singular features at very early times. In particular, the new cosmology approaches Minkowski spacetime in the limits of both the infinite past and the infinite future, thereby manifesting an intriguing symmetry between the two asymptotic regimes."}

Using the geometric framework of Ref.~\\cite{GRP}, we analyse the intrinsic curvature of the associated energy--momentum surfaces, where negative curvature ensures hyperbolic and stable propagation, and curvature sign changes or critical points indicate kinematical instabilities or new invariant scales. We apply this method exhaustively to all major MDRs derived in LQG and find that they remain strictly hyperbolic in the entire phenomenologically relevant regime, with no elliptic patches or critical branching. The same framework provides universal constraints on representative logarithmic, exponential and trigonometric MDRs beyond EFT. Thus, geometric criteria yield a unified and coordinate-independent assessment of stability, thresholds and invariant scales, and demonstrate the robustness of MDRs emerging from LQG."}

The direct imaging method captures exoplanet light while minimizing light from the host star. This is conventionally achieved with a coronagraph, which allows detailed characterization of planetary atmospheres and features. The Photonic Lantern Nuller (PLN) is an innovative instrument designed for the direct detection of closely orbiting exoplanets within the inner working angle of standard coronagraphs. Unlike traditional coronagraphs, where the planet's signal is usually rotationally invariant, with the same point-spread-function at different position angles, and which also overlaps minimally with the residual stellar signal, data from a PLN consist of a one-dimensional collection of points that do not have rotational invariance and overlap significantly with the residual starlight arising from wavefront errors. Exploiting angular diversity to subtract these stellar residuals with the PLN thus requires adapting the Angular Differential Imaging (ADI) technique for use with non-rotationally invariant planet signals at close separations, where strong self-subtraction effects occur. We reformulate ADI using principal component analysis to develop a method to extract spatial parameters of exoplanets from simulated one-dimensional PLN data. We test two variations of ADI on simulated data and show that injecting an antiplanet signal before stellar estimation helps localize the planet due to self-subtraction at lower separations."}

The origin of the flares is still unknown. We revisited the role of small planetary bodies, originally from the stellar disk, and their tidally disrupted fragments as a source of flaring activity in Sgr A*. We refined previous models by incorporating material strength constraints on the tidal disruption limit and by evaluating the evaporation dynamics of the resulting fragments. We analyzed the tidal fragmentation and gas-induced fragmentation of small planetary bodies with rubble-pile and monolithic structures. Using constraints from recent space missions (e.g., NASA OSIRIS-REx and JAXA Hayabusa2), we estimated the survivability of fragments under aerodynamic heating and computed their expected luminosity from ablation, modeled as fireball flares analogous to meteor events.\n  We find that planetary fragments can approach as close as 8 gravitational radii, consistent with observed flare locations. The fireball model yields luminosities from 1e34 to 1e36 erg/s for fragments whose parent bodies are a few kilometers in size. The derived flare frequency vs. luminosity distribution follows a power law with index 1.83, in agreement with observed values (1.65 - 1.9), while the flare duration scales as L^(-1/3), consistent with observations. We consider the young stars around Sgr A* as the planetary reservoir. Given a small-body population analogous in mass to the primordial Kuiper belt and the common existence of close-in super-Earths and long-period Neptunes, we show that this planetary reservoir can supply the observed flares."}

Additionally, we observed that increasing the DM parameter substantially enlarges the photon sphere, the critical impact parameter, and thus the shadow radius, whereas the magnetic charge $g$ produces only negligible corrections. The DM component also modifies the optical appearance of the accretion disk: higher $b$ systematically suppresses the observed radiation intensity and reduces image brightness, while changes in $g$ yield only marginal effects. Subsequently, using the Novikov-Thorne thin disk model, we analyze primary and secondary images, observed flux, and redshift patterns, showing that PFDM noticeably alters image size and brightness whereas magnetic charge has a negligible influence. No blueshifted regions appear in any configuration. These results highlight several promising observational signatures for testing DM environments and nonlinear electrodynamic effects around BHs."}

WL induces stringent requirements on the shape and stability of the VIS instrument system point spread function (PSF). The PSF is affected by error contributions from the telescope, the focal plane and image motion, and is controlled by a global error budget with error allocations to each contributor. Aims. During spacecraft development, we verified through a structural-thermal-optical performance (STOP) analysis that the built and verified telescope with its spacecraft interface meets the in-orbit steady-state and transient image quality requirements. Methods. For the purposes of the STOP analysis, a detailed finite-element mathematical model was set up and a standard set of test cases, both steady-state and transient, was defined, comprising combinations of worst-case boundary conditions. Results. The STOP analysis addressed the interaction of all spacecraft components in transmitting temperature-induced loads that lead to optical train deformation. The results of the prelaunch analysis demonstrated that temperature-induced optical perturbations will be well below the allowable limits for all permitted observing conditions. During the first year in orbit, we used the STOP analysis predictions to help interpret the measured performance as a function of environmental variables. Unpredicted disturbances were discovered and unexpected sensitivities were revealed. In-orbit temperature variations are small (<300 mK) and so are their effects on the telescope structure, but they are detected in the time histories of the image quality metrics and are a non-negligible factor in the PSF stability budget demanded by the WL science. Taking everything into account, our analysis confirms the excellent overall performance of the telescope."}

This solution describes an asymmetric wormhole connecting two different asymptotically flat spacetimes (two universes) in which there are in general different observed masses and charges. It is shown that, by suitably adjusting the values of free system parameters, at one end of the wormhole, one can obtain the values of the observed mass and charge typical of the Standard Model particles, whereas at the other end of the wormhole these physical quantities acquire the Planck values. Such a configuration incarnates Wheeler's idea of ``mass without mass'' and ``charge without charge'', and can be thought of as a model of a classical charge possessing a spin."}

The analysis covers the transition from a semi-degenerate to a highly degenerate electron gas and assumes temperatures above the melting threshold of the nuclear lattice, such that nuclei form a liquid. The transport coefficients are obtained by solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation in the relaxation-time approximation, fully incorporating the anisotropies generated by non-quantizing magnetic fields. Electron scattering rates include (i) dynamical screening of the electron-ion interaction in the hard-thermal-loop approximation of QED, (ii) ion-ion correlations within a one-component plasma, and (iii) finite nuclear-size effects. As an additional refinement, we evaluate electron-neutron scattering induced by the coupling of electrons to the anomalous magnetic moment of free neutrons; this contribution is found to be subdominant throughout the parameter range explored. To assess the sensitivity of transport coefficients to the underlying microphysics, we perform calculations for several inner-crust compositions obtained from different nuclear interactions and many-body methods. Across most of the crust, variations in relaxation times and in the components of the anisotropic thermal-conductivity and thermopower tensors reach up to factors 3-4 and 1.5-2, respectively, with the exception of the region where pasta phases are expected. These results provide updated, composition-dependent microphysical inputs for dissipative magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of warm neutron stars and post-merger remnants, where anisotropic heat and charge transport are of critical importance."}

To be submitted. Comments welcome. Code available at https://github.com/tingyuansen/Egent", "summary": "We present Egent, an autonomous agent that combines classical multi-Voigt profile fitting with large language model (LLM) visual inspection and iterative refinement. The fitting engine is built from scratch with minimal dependencies, creating an ecosystem where the LLM can reason about fits through function calls-adjusting wavelength windows, adding blend components, modifying continuum treatment, and flagging problematic cases. Egent operates directly on raw flux spectra without requiring pre-normalized continua. We validate against manual measurements from human experts using 18,615 lines from the C3PO program across 84 Magellan/MIKE spectra at SNR~50-250. We find per-spectrum systematic offsets between Egent and expert measurements, likely arising from differences in global continuum placement prior to manual fitting; after accounting for these offsets, the agreement is 5-7 milliangstrom. The LLM's primary role is quality control: it confirms good fits (~60-65% of lines are LLM-refined and accepted), flags problematic cases (~10-20%), and occasionally rescues edge cases where tool use improves fits. Agreement between GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini confirms reproducibility, with GPT-5-mini enabling low-cost analysis at ~200 lines per US dollar. Every fit stores complete Voigt parameters, continuum coefficients, and LLM reasoning chains, enabling exact reconstruction without re-running. Egent compresses what traditionally requires months of expert effort into days of automated analysis, enabling survey-scale EW measurement. We provide open-source code at https://github.com/tingyuansen/Egent, including a web interface for drag-and-drop analysis and a local LLM backend for fully offline operation on consumer hardware."}

We impose a general relativistic radiative transfer equation to determine the synchrotron emission from thermal electrons and generate horizon-scale images. In the RIAF-like model, we notice that the corresponding photon ring and central dark region are expanded with the aid of the PFDM parameter $η$, with brightness asymmetries originating at higher inclination angles and closely tied to flow dynamics and emission anisotropy. The fundamental difference between isotropic and anisotropic radiation is that anisotropy introduces vertical distortions in the higher-order images, resulting in an elliptical appearance. For the Hou disk model, the observed images produce narrower rings and dark interiors, while polarization patterns trace the brightness distribution and changes with the variations of the inclination angle and PFDM parameter $η$, which reflects the spacetime signature. All these results indicate that the observed intensity and polarization characteristics in the framework of thick disk models may serve as valuable probes of underlying spacetime geometry and the accretion-dynamics close to the horizon."}

In this work, we demonstrate that the pulsar-timing signature of LT precession for an arbitrary orbital orientation produces nonlinear orbital variations; if detected, these nonlinear variations provide a means to constrain $I_{\\rm p}$ without the need for timing-independent measurements of orbital geometry or distance. We show through simulations that these signatures are indeed detectable in pulsar-binary systems with an appropriate combination of timing precision and orbital geometry. Our simulations also show that nonlinear orbital variations from LT precession are expected to be detectable in PSR J1757$-$1854 after only 15 yr of dedicated timing."}

The relevant scattering matrix elements are calculated from one-plasmon exchange diagrams, with in-medium polarization tensors derived within hard-thermal-loop effective theory. Numerical results are obtained for matter composed of carbon nuclei. We find that the conductivity rises with temperature, following a power law sigma proportional to the 4th power of T in the semi-degenerate regime and sigma proportional to T in the nondegenerate regime, due to the intense creation of thermal electron-positron pairs and the resulting collisions among them.

In this study, we apply the RSM algorithm to analyze the F150 sample from the SHINE high-contrast imaging survey carried out with VLT/SPHERE, aiming to enhance detection limits and identify new exoplanet candidates. Additionally, we investigate how environmental conditions influence post-processed noise distributions and detection thresholds. We generate detection maps and contrast curves for 213 observations in the F150 SHINE sample using the RSM algorithm. A clustering approach based on environmental parameters is used to group observations with similar noise characteristics. We propose two methods for defining radial detection thresholds in the RSM maps: fitting a log-normal distribution to the post-processed noise and maximizing the F1 score. We also assess the performance of various combinations of post-processing techniques within the RSM framework to identify optimal configurations. This study demonstrates the utility of clustering based on observational parameters, effectively distinguishing features like wind-driven halos and low-wind effects. Detection thresholds vary significantly across clusters, differing by up to a factor of 10, highlighting the importance of considering observational environments. Log-normal thresholds provide conservative, noise-aware limits, while F1 score-based thresholds offer observation-specific results, both showing compatibility overall. RSM improves detection limits by an average factor of two at 1arcsec and five at inner working angles compared to standard PCA processing. This study reports more than 30 newly detected signals, including one promising candidate awaiting second-epoch confirmation."}

More specifically, we focus on the accretion of the Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG). To incorporate the global features of the GCG into this analysis, we employ the McVittie metric, which describes a black hole embedded in an expanding cosmological background. Within this framework, accretion is studied while consistently accounting for the backreaction on the metric components. Using a perturbative approach, we derive an expression for the effective black hole mass and for the evolution of both the black hole and cosmological apparent horizons under accretion. The analysis is performed in two distinct cosmological regimes: first, a matter-dominated era, and subsequently, a de Sitter era. In both cases, it is possible to determine analytically the instant in which accretion begins. For the matter-dominated era, the analytical expression shows that the greater the amount of matter available for accretion, the longer the accretion takes to start."}

To help settle this debate, we present a systematic, spatially resolved, spectroscopic analysis of both remnants using XMM-Newton. By applying multi-component thermal models, we derive key physical properties including elemental abundances, ejecta temperatures, ambient densities, and explosion energetics. We compare the inferred metal abundance ratios to a wide range of core-collapse and thermonuclear nucleosynthesis models, including new models whose explosion energies differ from the canonical value of $10^{51}$ ergs. We find that the observed Fe/Si and Ca/Si ratios in both SNRs are best matched by certain thermonuclear models. However, no model fully reproduces the complete set of observed abundance patterns. In 3C 397, high Fe enrichment and spatial abundance variations suggest interaction with a dense progenitor environment, and W49B's composition is overall consistent with a thermonuclear origin; however both require a low energy ($\\sim 10^{50}$ erg) supernova explosion. We additionally map the Fe K$α$ line centroid energies and find a spread, with W49B falling within the core-collapse region -- highlighting both environmental complexity and the limitations of this diagnostic for supernova classification. Our results highlight the need for caution in relying on any single diagnostic or nucleosynthesis model for supernova typing, underscore the need for improved nucleosynthesis models, and motivate future high-resolution, high-throughput observations."}

ARIMA models provide a versatile parametric description of stochastic variability in this context. However, their practical use is limited by the challenge of selecting optimal model orders while avoiding overfitting. We present a novel solution to this problem using a Bayesian framework for time series modelling in astronomy by combining Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models with the Nested Sampling algorithm. Our method yields Bayesian evidences for model comparison and also incorporates an intrinsic Occam's penalty for unnecessary model complexity. A vectorized ARIMA Nested Sampling framework is implemented allowing us to perform model selection across grids of Autoregressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA) orders, with efficient inference of selected model parameters. The method is validated on simulated and real astronomical time series, including the yearly sunspots number record, Kepler Lightcurves data of the red giant KIC 12008916, and TESS photometry of the exoplanet host star Ross 176. In all cases, the algorithm correctly identified the true or best-fitting model while simultaneously yielding well constrained posterior distributions for the model parameters. Our results demonstrate that Nested Sampling offers a potentially rigorous alternative to autoregressive model selection in astronomical time series analysis."}

We use new radio observations from the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) telescope, as well as several archival radio observations, to calculate spectral indices, and find a steep spectral index for the whole SNR ($α= -0.60\\pm0.02$), and a flatter spectral index for the PWN ($α= -0.16\\pm0.03$).

No additional bursts were detected from any of the 27 FRBs.

We also describe persistent vector memory effects associated with the leading angular vector mode, which are gauge invariant but do not affect the leading tidal observables.

We show that the disagreement is exacerbated as we raise the SNR threshold.

Observations with Fermi-LAT and HAWC have revealed a gamma-ray flux significantly higher than early theoretical predictions, with unexpected temporal and spectral features that suggest a crucial role of the solar magnetic field. In this work, we model GCR-induced gamma-ray emission at the solar disk using the CRPropa framework with realistic hadronic interactions, chromospheric density profiles, and several magnetic field configurations over the solar cycle. This allows us to quantify the gamma-ray emission of the entire solar disk for different phases of the solar activity cycle and we present, for the first time, maps of the production locations of gamma rays on the solar surface. We consider both mono-energetic and realistic power-law injection spectra in a simplified dipole-quadrupole current sheet model and potential-field source surface (PFSS) extrapolations for Carrington rotations during solar maximum and minimum. Our results show that magnetic mirroring and large-scale field topology strongly affect the spectral shape and spatial distribution of the emission, with slightly enhanced fluxes predicted at solar minimum. While our simulated baseline fluxes remain below observations, additional effects, such as heavier nuclei, Parker-field mirroring, and deeper atmospheric interactions, could result in further enhancements of fluxes closer to observational values. Hadronic interactions do not only produce gamma rays but also neutrinos. We estimate the expected neutrino flux from the Sun based on our gamma-ray predictions.

These functionals are often constructed by introducing density dependence into the nucleon-meson couplings, typically through functions that depend only on the vector, i.e., proper baryon density. In this work, we employ a Bayesian framework to investigate how different parametrizations, characterized by distinct functional forms and by their dependencies on vector and scalar densities, affect the properties of dense matter and compact stars. Our analysis demonstrates that although all considered parametrizations yield broadly comparable inferences, the differences in the equation of state and the symmetry energy remain significant at suprasaturation densities, reflecting the sensitivity to the chosen functional form of the density dependence. We find that allowing the nuclear saturation properties in the isoscalar channel, including the skewness coefficient $Q_{sat}$, to be freely adjusted provides adequate flexibility for the current modeling of nuclear and neutron star matter. In contrast, the isovector channel requires further refinement, with freedom extended at least up to the curvature coefficient $K_{sym}$ to capture variations in the symmetry energy and particle composition at high densities. This work advances prior studies by implementing a rational-function parametrization of the density dependence, informed and constrained by multimessenger astrophysical observations."}

The features of the rays near the photon spheres in not only black hole spacetimes but also exotic spacetimes would be important since one will need them to exclude black-hole mimickers. The deflection angles of the rays deflected by photon spheres diverge logarithmically and we can treat them by a strong-deflection-limit analysis. The error of the strong-deflection-limit analysis becomes large if antiphoton spheres exist in the spacetimes and the analysis breaks down when the photon spheres and the antiphoton spheres degenerate to form a marginally unstable photon sphere. This is because the deflection angles of the rays bent by the marginally unstable photon sphere diverge in powers. In this paper, we extend Eiroa, Romero, and Torres's method to gravitational lensing of rays inside and outside of the marginally unstable photon sphere in a general, static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically-flat spacetime in strong deflection limits and we apply it to a Reissner-Nordström spacetime and a Hayward spacetime with the marginally unstable photon sphere.

Motivated by two guiding principles for single-field perturbations -- the non-deformation of the boundary metric and the vanishing of electromagnetic energy flux at the AdS boundary -- we impose a boundary condition for Reissner-Nordström-AdS (RN-AdS) black holes requiring both the metric and electromagnetic field-strength perturbations to vanish at the AdS boundary, which we term the physical field-vanishing (PFV) condition. Using the formulas for perturbation reconstruction, we translate the PFV condition into boundary conditions on the master functions: Dirichlet-type for odd-parity modes and Robin-type for even-parity modes. With these boundary conditions, we compute the quasinormal frequencies of RN-AdS black holes and identify new spectral features. The PFV prescription introduced here could be applied to other multifield perturbation systems in asymptotically AdS spacetimes."}

These models are characterized by their extreme compactness and incorporation of a quantum core, successfully avoiding the curvature singularities typically associated with classical general relativity. Central to these models is the noncommutative parameter, which plays a crucial role in determining stellar properties and enables the exploration of various astrophysical regimes. While pure Planckian effects pose significant challenges for observational detection, our findings suggest that lower energy scales may reveal exotic stellar objects with Earth and Sun-like masses that lack classical counterparts, potentially providing the first experimental evidence of non-classical gravity. We propose that the metrics derived in this study can be tested against known neutron stars, offering promising avenues for future research aimed at understanding the interplay between quantum effects in gravity and stellar evolution, ultimately enhancing our comprehension of the universe's fundamental properties."}

We argue that the mm emission comes from a spatially extended region that is magnetically connected to the compact X-ray corona, in analogy to the solar wind and corona. We present an analytic model scaled to corona values in which non-equipartition electrons from multiple heights along an extended conical outflow shape the mm emission. In this model, the 100 GHz emission originates from within $\\lesssim10^4$ gravitational radii ($r_g$) of the central black hole, though the projected distance from the black hole can be as low as $50r_g$ depending on the line-of-sight. Our model predicts a flat emission spectrum $F_ν\\sim{\\rm const}$ and a mm-to-X-ray luminosity ratio $L_{\\rm mm}/L_X\\sim10^{-4}$, consistent with observations. These quantities depend weakly on the underlying electron power-law distribution function and black hole mass. We demonstrate this model's plausibility using a general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation of a thin accretion disc as a case study. Our model highlights the need to study continual dissipation along the outflow to connect the X-ray- and mm-emitting regions."}

For magnetic black holes, we compute the Lee-Nair-Weinberg instability and revisit early universe pair creation rates, including singular instantons that substantially enhance production, to demonstrate that the extreme charges required for stability are cosmologically implausible.

Its remarkably bright emission, partially due to its close distance to Earth ($z\\sim0.15$), makes this GRB a unique event. The outstanding characteristics of GRB 221009A, including the TeV detection by the LHAASO experiment, triggered deep follow-up observations of the source across all wavebands, including very-high-energy gamma rays with the first Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1) of the future Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory. LST-1 observations started about one day after the onset of the prompt emission, under strong moonlight conditions. This resulted in a hint of a signal with a statistical significance of about 4$σ$. The monitoring of this source continued until the end of November 2022. This constitutes the deepest observation campaign performed on a GRB with LST-1. Here we show the results of this follow-up campaign."}

We demonstrate that it universally decomposes into two contributions, one arising from the explicit dependence of the action on the couplings and the other from the response of the fundamental dynamical fields.

Consequently, thermodynamic quantities-including the Hawking temperature, Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and heat capacity-become explicit functions of these additional parameters, with the heat capacity exhibiting divergences that signal phase transitions. We analyze the motion of massive test particles in this spacetime, deriving the effective potential and calculating the innermost stable circular orbit radius, which governs the inner edge of accretion disks and influences orbital stability. Scalar perturbations are examined through the associated effective potential, and quasinormal mode frequencies are computed using the sixth-order WKB approximation; the negative imaginary parts confirm the stability of the black hole under such perturbations. We also study the photon sphere structure, black hole shadow radius, and photon trajectories, showing how the interplay between string clouds and the electromagnetic background shapes the optical properties of this spacetime. Finally, we investigate weak gravitational lensing phenomena by deriving the deflection angle for both massive particles and photons using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem applied to the optical geometry. The results exhibit notable deviations from the Schwarzschild geometry, with the string cloud enhancing the deflection through a $(1-α)^{-1}$ factor while the electromagnetic parameter introduces competing corrections at second order."}

We find that scalar hair modestly alters the inflow and magnetic-field structure but strengthens gravitational redshift, markedly reducing the total flux and lensed ring brightness through relativistic transfer and spectral-shift effects. Moreover, we highlight a previously unexplored channel: the maximum interferometric diameter of the first photon ring responds strongly to the hair parameter but shows little dependence on accretion-flow details, making it a promising observable for constraining black-hole hair with future space-based interferometry."}

In the case of a massive entropic environment, the attractor Bunch--Davies vacuum plays a special role: it is the only state that can undergo full recoherence, whereas all excited initial states exhibit persistent loss of purity. To characterize this behavior, we parameterize excited Gaussian initial states by their Bogoliubov coefficients and compute the purity and Rényi-2 entropy of the reduced adiabatic state as information-theoretic indicators of decoherence dynamics. We find that excited states display \\emph{purity-freezing} at a non-zero plateau, where residual quantum correlations persist indefinitely, a qualitative departure from the complete recoherence observed for the Bunch--Davies vacuum. This sensitivity to initial conditions highlights the non-generic nature of full recoherence in the quantum-to-classical transition of inflationary perturbations."}
