Abstract: It is generally assumed that any discrepancy between an object's inertial and gravitational masses, leading to a violation of the equivalence principle, arises from the nature of its internal constituents and their interactions. We show here that the difference can instead be a function of the distance of the object from a gravitating body, and suggest ways of testing this, illustrating side-by-side a covariant framework for the same.

Abstract: Stochastic inflation is widely used as a framework to study scalar field perturbations on an inflationary spacetime in a classical manner. In Starobinsky's seminal work and most of the subsequent literature, stochastic inflation is driven by a white noise. This is a consequence of a number of assumptions about the background metric, the window function, and the initial state. Given that noise is the central object in this approach, it is worthwhile to investigate how the noise is modified upon relaxing some of these assumptions. We show that while deviation from an exact de Sitter background maintains the white character of the noise (only with a time-dependent amplitude), deviation from the Heaviside window function or the Bunch-Davies initial state can produce colored noise. We calculate the power spectrum and the memory of the noise for a toy model with a piecewise linear window function. We also show that, in order to produce a colored noise, the deviation from the Bunch-Davies vacuum should essentially be a sum of two-particle states. The resulting noise is non-stationary and we find its instantaneous power spectrum in a concrete example. Furthermore, while deviations from de Sitter background and sharp cutoff do not affect Gaussianity, changing the initial state yields a non-Gaussian noise.

Abstract: Since the first detection of gravitational waves in 2015 by LIGO from the binary black hole merger GW150914, gravitational wave astronomy has developed significantly, with over 200 compact binary merger events cataloged. The use of neural networks has the potential to significantly speed up the detection, classification, and especially parameter estimation for gravitational wave events, compared to current techniques, quite important for electromagnetic follow-up of events. In this work, we present a machine learning pipeline using neural networks to detect gravitational wave events. We generate training data using real LIGO data to train and refine neural networks that can detect binary black hole (BBH) mergers, and apply these models to search through LIGO's first three observing runs. We detect 57 out of the 75 total cataloged BBH events with two detectors of data in O1, O2, and O3, with 57 false positives that can mostly be ruled out with parameter inference and human inspection. Finally, we extensively test this pipeline on time-shifted data to characterize its False Alarm Rate (FAR). These results are an important step in developing machine learning-based GW searches, enabling low-latency detection and multi-messenger astronomy.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We systematically investigate the quasinormal modes of thick branes in $f(R)$ gravity by numerically solving the Schrödinger-like perturbation equation of gravitational perturbations. To ensure the reliability of the results, we employ three complementary methods: the asymptotic iteration method, the direct integration of the wave equation, and the time-domain numerical evolution. We analyze how the model parameters influence the shape of the effective potential of gravitational perturbations and find that the structure of the potential barrier plays a significant role in shaping the quasinormal frequency spectrum. The results obtained from the three methods exhibit strong consistency, thereby ensuring the reliability of the calculations. In particular, the real parts of the quasinormal frequencies exhibit an approximately arithmetic progression, suggesting that the quasi-localized states can be understood as resonances between the barriers.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Lyapunov exponents of chaos for both massless and charged particles around a non-linear electrodynamics black hole, and explore their relationships with a phase transition and a chaos bound of this black hole. Our results indicate that these exponents can effectively reveal the phase transition. Specifically, during the phase transition, the violation of the chaos bound occurs solely within a stable branch of a small black hole. Moreover, regardless of whether the phase transition takes place, the violations are observed.

Abstract: We examine observational discrepancies of two widely used models describing anisotropic (dark) matter distributions around a black hole, focusing on their photon spheres, shadow radii, and lensing observables. The models considered are the vacuum and Einstein cluster dark matter model, characterized by negative and zero radial pressure, respectively. The analysis reveals that these models display contrasting photon sphere behavior. In particular, the Einstein cluster results in a more pronounced deviation in the shadow radius relative to the standard Schwarzschild black hole. Additionally, a distinctive lensing phenomenon associated with the matter halo is identified in both models.

Abstract: We extend a recently proposed Monte Carlo scheme for computing stationary solutions of the general-relativistic Vlasov equation to the Kerr spacetime. As an example, we focus on razor-thin configurations of a gas confined to the equatorial plane and extending to spatial infinity. We consider monoenergetic models as well as solutions corresponding to planar Maxwell-Jüttner distributions at infinity. In both cases, the components of the particle current surface density are recovered within the proposed Monte Carlo framework. Some aspects of razor-thin kinetic disk models, including an analysis of the bulk angular momentum and angular velocity, are briefly covered.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We explore the possibility of parity-violating, nonminimally coupled 2-form field theories that retain the same dynamical degrees of freedom as a massive 2-form and thus are ghost-free. Starting from the most general kinetic terms and dimension four couplings between the 2-form field and the curvature tensors, we find a two-parameter family of such theories. However, we also find that parity-violating terms involving the dual 2-form field can be absorbed into a field redefinition, leaving a theory with essentially the same structure as that obtained by Heisenberg and Trenkler (i.e., the parity-preserving coupling to the double dual Riemann tensor). After the field redefinition, the only place where parity-violating terms can appear is in the potential. We then consider a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model with an isotropic configuration of a triplet of 2-form fields, and study tensor perturbations in this setup. There are three types of tensor perturbations, two of which are dynamical. We show that chiral gravitational waves can be generated in the presence of parity-violating terms in the potential.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the accretion dynamics and test particle motion around a non-rotating, spherically symmetric Lee-Wick black hole (BH) to reveal how the model parameters affect orbital stability and the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in X-ray binary systems. The spacetime geometry, characterized by the BH mass and the coupling parameters $S_1$ and $S_2$, includes exponential and oscillatory corrections arising from the Lee-Wick terms. Using the effective potential approach, we derive specific energy, angular momentum, epicyclic frequencies, and the locations of the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) of test particles. In addition to the analytical analysis, we explore the effects of the Lee-Wick spacetime parameters on the shock-cone morphology produced by Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion. To this end, we perform general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations in two characteristic regimes: Block-1 (weak Lee-Wick regime) and Block-2 (strong Lee-Wick regime). The results show that Block-1 solutions closely resemble the Schwarzschild case, while Block-2 models develop denser and asymmetric shock cones accompanied by stronger QPOs activity, shifting from low-frequency to high-frequency QPOs. These variations yield distinct observational signatures that may be detectable in high-resolution X-ray timing data. Our analytical and numerical findings demonstrate that the Lee-Wick parameters $S_1$ and $S_2$ cause measurable changes in the morphology of the accretion flow and in the frequency ratios near the BH. This suggests that future multi-wavelength observations could provide an important avenue to test higher-derivative gravity theories.

For illustration purposes, we present the minimal version of the initial phases of the collapse together with an analysis of the corresponding junction conditions.

Abstract: We investigate quantum entanglement and coherence for four classes of Bell-like fermionic states in the vicinity of the event horizon of a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilaton black hole. Contrary to the common expectation that maximally entangled states always provide superior quantum resources, our results show that their entanglement can be lower than that of suitably chosen non-maximally entangled states in this curved spacetime background. This reveals that non-maximally entangled states may offer operational advantages for entanglement-based tasks under gravitational effects. In contrast, quantum coherence exhibits monotonic behavior: larger initial coherence leads to systematically enhanced robustness against the dilaton induced degradation. These results indicate that the optimal choice of initial quantum states depends sensitively on the specific quantum resource, either quantum entanglement or quantum coherence, required for quantum information processing near a dilaton black hole.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The recently discovered gravitational wave event GW231123 was interpreted as the merger of two black holes with a total mass of 190-265 $M_\odot$, making it the heaviest such merger detected to date. Whilst much of the post-discovery literature has focused on its astrophysical origins, primary analyses have exhibited considerable discrepancies in the measurement of source properties between waveform models, which cannot reliably be reproduced by simulations. Such discrepancies may arise when an unaccounted overlapping signal is present in the data, or from phenomena that produce similar effects, such as gravitational lensing or overlapping noise artifacts. In this work, we analyse GW231123 using a flexible model that allows for two overlapping signals, and find that it is favoured over the isolated signal model with Bayes factors of $\sim 10^2 - 10^{4}$, depending on the waveform model. These values lie within the top few per cent of the background distribution. Similar effects are not observed in GW190521, another high-mass event. Under the overlapping signals model, discrepancies in the measurement of source properties between waveform models are largely mitigated, and the two recovered sources show similar properties. Additionally, we find that neglecting an additional signal in overlapping-signal data can lead to discrepancies in the estimated source properties resembling those reported in GW231123.

Abstract: We investigate quantum information and thermodynamic properties of a new bumblebee black hole arising from spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking by analyzing near-horizon physics through complementary quantum probes. We study the degradation of quantum entanglement for field modes shared by inertial and accelerated observers in spacelike and lightlike Lorentz-violating vacua that generate identical spacetime metrics. Using the near-horizon Rindler correspondence, we derive analytic expressions for the logarithmic negativity and mutual information and examine their dependence on detector position, frequency, and Lorentz-violation parameters. Despite sharing the same metric, the two Lorentz-violating vacua become distinguishable near the horizon, particularly at low frequencies. We analyze the excitation of a freely falling two-level atom coupled to quantum fields near the horizon. The associated acceleration-radiation transition probabilities are computed explicitly. The resulting atomic response is locally indistinguishable from that in flat spacetime, confirming the validity of the equivalence principle even in the presence of Lorentz-violating corrections. Finally, we extend the notion of horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) entropy to the bumblebee black hole and derive the corresponding entropy production rate induced by infalling atoms.

Abstract: We study slowly rotating black hole solutions within Degenerate Higher Order Scalar Tensor (DHOST) theories. Starting from a static, spherically symmetric metric solution of a DHOST theory, we employ the Hartle-Thorne ansatz to model a slowly rotating spacetime. We show that the differential equation governing the frame-dragging function $ω$ (which is supposed to depend on the radial coordinate only) is integrable for any DHOST theory allowing us to obtain its explicit form. We also consider angular dependence in $ω$ and show that regularity at the horizon and at infinity forbids it, as in General Relativity. As an illustration of the formalism introduced here, we study the slowly-rotating version of black hole solutions with primary hair obtained recently, examining the influence of the rotation on the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) and on the circular light trajectories in the equatorial plane.

Abstract: In recent years, jumps in the particle circular-orbit radius $r_{\rm c}$ have been proposed as observational signatures of black hole phase transitions, supported by the general consensus that $r_{\rm c}$ increases monotonically with the horizon radius $r_h$. However, in this paper, we will show that this monotonicity is not universally valid. By deriving a universal, ensemble-independent criterion for $\mathrm{d}r_{\rm c}/\mathrm{d}r_h$ and applying it to the $d$-dimensional Reissner-Nordström-Anti-de Sitter black hole, we reveal a sharp dichotomy: while $r_{\rm c}(r_h)$ exhibits strictly monotonicity along isobars, it typically becomes non-monotonic along isotherms (except for the photon sphere of Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter black hole)--a behavior that has been overlooked in previous studies. Nevertheless, we rigorously prove that within the phase-transition region itself, the monotonicity of $r_{\rm c}(r_h)$ is preserved. However, the generalizability of this result to other spacetimes requires case-by-case verification, and its validity could have notable implications for the observability of the jump in $r_{\rm c}$. Interestingly, non-monotonicity itself acts as a new observational probe: the monotonicity contrast in $r_{\rm c}(r_h)$ distinguishes isobaric from isothermal evolution, providing a complementary thermodynamic probe. Furthermore, we show that the critical exponents extracted from $r_{\rm c}$ match those obtained from $r_h$, independent of ensemble. Remarkably, all these phenomena are closely tied to the thermodynamic first law.

Abstract: We present numerical solutions for stationary and axisymmetric equilibriums of compact stars associated with extremely strong magnetic fields. The interior of the compact stars is assumed to satisfy ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) conditions, while in the region of negligible mass density the force-free conditions or electromagnetic vacuum are assumed. Solving all components of Einstein's equations, Maxwell's equations, ideal MHD equations, and force-free conditions, equilibriums of rotating compact stars associated with mixed poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields are obtained. It is found that in the extreme cases the strong mixed magnetic fields concentrating in a toroidal region near the equatorial surface expel the matter and form a force-free toroidal magnetotunnel. We also introduce a new differential rotation law for computing solutions associated with force-free magnetosphere, and present other extreme models without the magnetotunnel.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We review an approach that uses binary relations as the fundamental constituents of the universe, utilizing them as building blocks for both space and matter. The model is defined by an ultraviolet continuous fixed point of a statistical model on random networks, governed by the combinatorial Ollivier-Ricci curvature, which acts as a network analogue of the Einstein-Hilbert action. The model exhibits two distinct phases separated by this fixed point, a geometric and a random phase, representing space and matter, respectively. At weak coupling and on large scales, the network organizes into a holographic surface whose collective state encodes both an emergent 3D space and the matter distributed in it. The Einstein equations emerge as constitutive relations expressing matter in terms of fundamental network degrees of freedom while dynamics in a comoving frame is governed by relativistic quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics, however is an effective theory breaking down at the scale of the radius of curvature of the holographic network. On smaller scales, not only relativistic invariance is lost but also the Lorentzian signature of space-time. Finally, the manifold nature of space-time breaks down on the Planck length, where the random character of the fundamental network on the smallest scales becomes apparent. The network model seems to naturally encode several of the large-distance features of cosmology, albeit still at a qualitative level. The holographic property of black holes arises intrinsically from the expander nature of random regular graphs. There is a natural mechanism to resolve the cosmological constant problem and dark matter appears naturally as a metastable allotrope in the network fabric of space-time. In this model, both gravity and quantum mechanics are macroscopic statistical effects reflecting the free energy minimization of fundamental binary degrees of freedom.

Abstract: Exploring gravitational theories beyond general relativity (GR) with black hole (BH) spectroscopy requires accurate and flexible methods for computing their quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum. A popular method of choice is the higher-order Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation, mostly applied to nonrotating BHs. While previous studies demonstrated that the higher-order WKB method can also be used for Kerr BHs in GR, there has been little work on rotating BHs in modified theories of gravity. In this work, we revive the idea by extending WKB calculations of the Kerr QNM spectrum to higher order and assessing its accuracy against continued-fraction tabulated data. We then apply the WKB approximation beyond GR, comparing it against both linearized and continued fraction calculations in the parametrized beyond-Teukolsky formalism and in higher-derivative gravity (HDG) theories. We find that the frequencies computed by the WKB method in theories beyond GR have better accuracy than the measurement errors for GW250114, the event with the highest ringdown signal-to-noise ratio observed to date.

Abstract: We analyze the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor and its fluctuations in quantum field theory on curved spacetimes $\langle T_{ab} \rangle$. A necessary condition for the conceptual consistency of semiclassical gravity, where $\langle T_{ab} \rangle$ represent the sources of the Einstein equations, is that the fluctuations of the energy momentum tensor remain small compared to its expectation value. We study the renormalization of both the energy-momentum tensor $\langle T_{ab}(x)\rangle_{\rm ren}$ and the fluctuation tensor $\langle T_{ab}(x) T_{cd}(x) \rangle_{\rm ren}$ for suitable Hadamard states, using the operator product expansion for a free scalar field on a fixed curved background. We show that squeezed vacua -- arising naturally in black hole evaporation and in inflationary cosmology -- fail to satisfy the semiclassicality criterion.

Abstract: This work presents a universal and revisited formalism for the entropy of the apparent horizon in modified gravity to investigate the validity of the Generalized Second Law (GSL) of thermodynamics. This revisited horizon entropy is constructed directly from the modified Friedmann equations in a non-flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe. The resulting entropy relation contains, beside the standard Bekenstein-Hawking term, an additional integral contribution that encodes the effective energy density and pressure generated by deviations from general relativity. Using this universal entropy formula, a compact expression for the GSL is derived. This formalism is then applied to some viable $f(T)$ and $f(R)$ gravity models, in order to re-evaluate the validity of the GSL as a function of redshift. The analysis demonstrates that including the integral term in the revisited entropy can relatively improve the late-time validity of the GSL for some of these models while living others unchanged, thereby reinforcing the profound connection between thermodynamics and gravity.

Abstract: Superradiant instabilities of rotating black holes can give rise to long-lived bosonic clouds, offering natural laboratories to probe ultralight particles across a wide range of parameter space. The presence of a companion can dramatically impact both the cloud's evolution and the binary's orbital dynamics, generating a trail of feedback effects that require detailed modelling. Using a worldline effective field theory approach, we develop a systematic framework for binaries on generic (eccentric and inclined) orbits, capturing both resonant and non-resonant transitions without relying solely on balance laws. We demonstrate the existence of ``co-rotating'' floating orbits that can deplete the cloud prior to entering the detector's band, triggering eccentricity growth towards a sequence of fixed points. Likewise, we show that ``counter-rotating'' orbits can also deplete the cloud, driving (unbounded) growth of eccentricity. Furthermore, we uncover novel features tied to orbital inclination. Depending on the mass ratio, equatorial orbits can become unstable, and fixed points may arise not only for aligned or anti-aligned configurations but, strikingly, also at intermediate inclinations. We derive flow equations governing spin-orbit misalignment and eccentricity and identify distinctive signatures that can reveal the presence of boson clouds in the binary's history, as well as key features of possible in-band transitions. These results refine and extend earlier work, yielding a more faithful description of the imprints of ultralight particles in gravitational-wave signals from binary black holes, signatures that are within reach of future detectors such as LISA, Cosmic Explorer, and the Einstein~Telescope.

Abstract: We provide an overview of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equation (GPPE) that is used to model self-gravitating superfluid systems, which include gravitationally collapsed boson and axion stars and dark-matter haloes. We outline how this framework can be used to develop minimal models for neutron stars and for pulsars and their glitches. We account not only for vortices in the neutron superfluid inside these stars, but also for the flux tubes in the proton-superconductor subsystem, using a coupled model with the neutron superfluid, proton superconductor, the Maxwell equations for the vector potential ${\bf A}$, and the Poisson equation for self-gravity.

Abstract: HESS J1857+026 remains a mysterious gamma-ray emitter since its discovery in 2008. Despite the disclosure of a nearby pulsar and multiple studies in the high-energy (HE, E > 100 MeV) and very-high-energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV) regimes, there have been no confirmed counterparts (e.g., an SNR shell or other extended structure) in X-ray or other wavelengths. We present the result of our study of the VHE emission of HESS~J1857+026 with VERITAS as part of a multi-wavelength investigation to uncover its emission mechanisms. Our result confirms the extended nature of the source and we characterize its spectral and morphological features in the VHE band. Using the morphology of the source revealed in our analysis, we also explore the underlying transport process of a possible electron population in a leptonic PWN scenario for the gamma-ray emission.

Abstract: We present constraints on the nanohertz gravitational wave background (GWB) using X-ray pulsar timing data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer(\textit{NICER}). By analyzing six millisecond pulsars over a six-year observational baseline, we employed a Bayesian framework to model noise components and search for a common red signal consistent with a GWB from supermassive black hole binaries (assuming a spectral index $γ_{\rm gwb}=13/3$). Our results show no significant evidence for a GWB, yielding a 95\% upper limit of $\log_{10}(A_{\rm gwb})<-13.4$. Weak evidence for Hellings-Downs spatial correlations was found (S=2.5), though the signal remains statistically inconclusive. Compared to radio and $γ$-ray pulsar timing arrays, the \textit{NICER} constraint is currently less stringent but demonstrates the feasibility of X-ray timing with \textit{NICER} for GWB studies and highlights the potential for improved sensitivity with future X-ray missions.

Abstract: The high magnetic fields and rapid spins of young pulsars associated with supernova remnants, such as the Crab and the Vela, established the standard pulsar model in which massive stellar explosions produce rapidly rotating, radio-luminous neutron stars. Central Compact Objects (CCOs), identified in X-rays at the centers of other remnants, challenged this view, as decades of searches yielded no radio detections. Here we show that the prototypical young CCO 1E 1207.4-5209 is in fact a faint radio pulsar rotating at the 0.4s X-ray period. Analysis of its polarization indicates that the radio beam intersects our line of sight near the magnetic pole, affirming its radio faintness' being intrinsic. Once its supernova remnant dissipates, this source would be misidentified as an apparently gigayear-old pulsar. The CCO's low radio flux density may explain why many supernova remnants lack detectable radio pulsars and suggests a hidden population of young, slowly rotating neutron stars.

Abstract: Ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories have transformed our view of compact-object mergers, yet their reach still limits a comprehensive reconstruction of the processes that generate these systems. Only next-generation observatories, with order-of-magnitude improvements in sensitivity and access to lower frequencies, will be capable of radically extending this detection horizon. GW observations will make it possible to detect the complete population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to redshifts of $z \simeq 100$. This capability will deliver an unprecedented map of merger events across cosmic time and enable precise reconstruction of their mass and spin distributions, while for several thousand events the signal-to-noise ratio will surpass 100, enabling precision physics of BHs and neutron stars (NSs). The access to lower frequencies will also open the intermediate-mass window, detecting systems of order $\sim 10^3 M_\odot$, potentially in coordination with multi-band observations from LISA. At higher redshifts, where Population III stars have so far remained beyond reach - even for the James Webb Space Telescope - GW observations by next-generation detectors will routinely provide observations of BH mergers thought to originate from these primordial stellar populations. Such measurements are expected to play a central role in clarifying the early assembly of supermassive black holes. A single detection of a binary BH system at $z \gtrsim 30$, or of a compact object with sub-solar mass and no tidal deformability, would constitute strong evidence for the existence of primordial black holes. Such a discovery would have profound consequences for our understanding of dark matter and the early Universe. Ultimately, the GW observations will become revolutionary for identifying the physical channels responsible for compact binary formation.

Abstract: We present a parameterized model of atmospheric particle showers initiated by cosmic rays. Few physics shower parameters are tuned in a comparison to the Conex generator. Resulting shower properties are studied, with a comment on the cases where multiple shower maxima develop.
  Finally, we implement simple models of new physics resonance of masses of 100 GeV and 1 TeV and examine their effects on the shower profile, depth and maximum variation in dependence of the decay channel of the hypothetical resonance. It is shown that a new resonance effects can appear at the energy threshold and can persist for about a decade in $\log_{10} E/\mathrm{eV}$.
  Various assumed decay modes of the hypothetical resonance have different effects on the direction and shape of the modified average shower depth as function of the energy, with possible implications for current or future measurements. It is shown that, within the presented model, the visibility of the resonance in modified shower depth strongly depends on the resonance width. A significant modification at 10\% width gradually diminishes towards the percent-level width. We propose that looking at the 2D distributions of the two first individual shower moments can also reveal signatures of new physics.

Abstract: The advent of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) and recent advances in reconstruction of gamma-ray photons with Cherenkov telescopes are bound to push the limit of angular resolution to an unprecedented precision of less than one arcminute at tens of TeV. Naturally, such instrumental improvements open up possibilities for new and interesting scientific studies. We aim to show that the study of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) in particular is bound to profit from these high-resolution measurements. This is because PWNe are the dominant Galactic source population at TeV energies, exhibit hard spectra up to hundreds of TeV and from X-ray observations are known to possess plentiful structure on arcminute scales. Using HESS J1813-178 and MSH 15-52 as examples, we create simple leptonic models of the TeV morphology of these sources based on X-ray observations and existing gamma-ray measurements. Then, assuming different models for the exposure and point spread function of the observatory, we create mock observations with the future CTAO southern array. We use these to assess the ability of these observations to differentiate between models and study the physics of these sources, in particular to infer the structure of the magnetic field and electron distributions. We find that future observations with the CTAO southern array at multi-TeV energies - in combination with existing X-ray measurements - will likely be able to constrain the distributions of magnetic field and high-energy electrons in these sources. We demonstrate that the sensitivity of these measurements can be significantly enhanced with the improved angular resolution achievable with novel reconstruction algorithms. However, we also show that in the relevant multi-TeV regime, signal-photon statistics remain a limitation and trading event statistics for improved angular resolution is not necessarily advantageous.

Abstract: We present LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) studies of supernovae SN 1979C, SN 1986J, and SN 2006X, focusing on new observations from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) and the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT). For Type Ia SN 2006X, we derive a 3$σ$ upper limit of 0.7 mJy at 0.146 GHz, and using radio emission models based on the CS15DD2 explosion model, we constrain the circumstellar density to $n_{\rm H} \lesssim 10$ cm$^{-3}$ for the microphysical parameters $ε_{\rm rel} = ε_{\rm B} = 0.01$. SN 1979C is clearly detected in the LoTSS image with a flux density of $4.6 \pm 0.36$ mJy nearly 40 years postexplosion. Modeling its radio evolution suggests a steep flux decay ($F_ν \propto t^{-2.1}$) between 22 and 42 years, a break in the spectrum near 1.5 GHz possibly due to synchrotron cooling, a progenitor mass of $\sim 13$ solar masses, and a progressive steepening with velocity for the density slope of the supernova ejecta. Our findings for SN 1979C contradict scenarios involving central compact object emission, and we obtain X-ray temperatures close to those derived from recent observations. For SN 1986J, we present the first ILT image showing a flux density of $6.77\pm0.2$ mJy at 0.146 GHz. The spectral index of the shell emission is found to be $0.66\pm0.03$, consistent with previous estimates, although variations at low frequencies warrant further investigation. Our results highlight the power of LOFAR for studying long-term radio evolution in supernovae.

Abstract: We present a spectroscopic analysis of XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations of the 'complex' NLS1 PG 1535+547 at redshift $z=0.038$. These observations span three epochs: 2002 and 2006 with XMM-Newton alone, covering the $0.3-10$ keV energy range, and a coordinated XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observation in 2016, covering the $0.3-60$ keV energy range. The X-ray spectra across all epochs exhibit both neutral and ionized absorption, along with reflection features from the accretion disc, including a prominent Compton hump in the broadband data. Notably, the spectral shape varies across epochs. Our analysis suggests this variability is attributed to changes in both line-of-sight absorption and the intrinsic emission from PG 1535+547. The source is obscured by multiple layers of partially and/or fully covering neutral and ionized absorbers, with neutral column densities ranging from undetectable levels in the least obscured phase to $\sim0.3-5\times10^{23}\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ in the most obscured phase. A clear warm absorber is revealed during the least obscured phase. The continuum remains fairly consistent ($Γ\approx 2.2\pm0.1$) during the first two observations, followed by a substantial flux decrease (by a factor of $\sim7$ in the $2-10$ keV band) in 2016 compared to 2006. The 2016 data indicates the source is in a reflection-dominated state during this epoch, with a reflection fraction of $R>7$ and an X-ray source located at a height $\leq 1.72r_g$. Simultaneous fitting of the multi-epoch data suggests a rapidly rotating black hole with a spin parameter, $a>0.99$. These findings imply that strong light-bending effects may account for the observed continuum flux reduction.

Abstract: The Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) is currently under construction with the aim to detect neutrinos with energies beyond $\sim 10\,\mathrm{PeV}$. A critical part of early detector commissioning is the study of detector characteristics and potential backgrounds, for which cosmic rays play a crucial role. In this article, we report that the number of cosmic rays detected with RNO-G's shallow antennas is consistent with expectations. We further verified the agreement in the observed cosmic-ray signal shape with expectations from simulations after careful treatment of the detector systematics. Finally, we find that the reconstructed arrival direction, energy, and polarization of the cosmic-ray candidates agrees with expectations. Throughout this study, we identified detector shortcomings that are mitigated going forward. Overall, the analysis presented here is an essential first step towards validating the detector and high-fidelity neutrino detection with RNO-G in the future.

Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has observed a diffuse flux of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos for more than a decade. A relevant background to the astrophysical flux is prompt atmospheric neutrinos, originating from the decay of charmed mesons produced in cosmic-ray-induced air showers. The production rate of charmed mesons in the very forward phase space of hadronic interactions, and consequently, the prompt neutrino flux, remains uncertain and has not yet been observed by neutrino detectors. An accurate measurement of this flux would enhance our understanding of fundamental particle physics such as hadronic interactions in high-energy cosmic-ray-induced air showers and the nucleon structure. Furthermore, an experimental characterization of this background flux will improve the precision of astrophysical neutrino flux spectral measurements. In this work, we perform a combined fit of cascade-like and track-like neutrino events in IceCube to constrain the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux. Given that the prompt flux is a sub-dominant contribution, treating systematic uncertainties arising from the potential mis-modeling of the conventional and astrophysical neutrino fluxes is critical for its measurement. Our analysis yields a non-zero best-fit result, which is, however, consistent with the null hypothesis of no prompt flux within one standard deviation. Consequently, we establish an upper bound on the flux at $4\times 10^{-16}$ (GeV m$^2$ s sr)$^{-1}$ at 10 TeV.

Abstract: The exteriors of stellar and galactic dynamos are usually modeled as a current-free potential field. A more realistic description might be that of a force-free magnetic field. Here, we suggest that, in the absence of outflows, neither of those reflect the actual behavior when the magnetic field spreads diffusively into a more poorly conducting turbulent exterior outside dynamo. In particular, we show that the usual ordering of the dipole magnetic field being the most slowly decaying one is altered, and that the quadrupole can develop a toroidal component that decays even more slowly with radial distance. This behavior is best seen for spherical dynamo volumes and becomes more complicated for oblate ones. In either case, however, those fields are confined within a magnetosphere beyond which the field drops exponentially. The magnetosphere expands ballistically (i.e., linearly in time $t$) during the exponential growth phase of the dynamo, but diffusively proportional to $t^{1/2}$ during the saturated phase. We demonstrate that the Faraday displacement current, which plays a role in a vacuum, can safely be neglected in all cases. For quadrupolar configurations, the synchrotron emission from the magnetosphere is found to be constant along concentric rings. The total and the polarized radio emissions from the dipolar or the quadrupolar configurations display large scale radial trends that are potentially distinguishable with existing radio telescopes. The superposition of magnetic fields from galaxies in the outskirts of the voids between galaxy clusters can therefore not explain the void magnetization of the intergalactic medium, reinforcing the conventional expectation that those fields are of primordial origin.

A key diagnostic for their nature is the spiral arm pattern speed: the radial profile of the angular rotation rate of spiral features. This profile determines the location and number of dynamical resonances where peculiar motions and azimuthal metallicity fluctuations in stars and gas can manifest; their precise patterns have the potential to support or reject theories of spiral structure. However, limited observations of this type have been carried out so far, despite an increasing number of theoretical predictions emerging from realistic and detailed cosmological simulations. A systematic observational programme focussed on the resolved kinematics and metallicities of stellar populations around galaxy spiral arms is required to confront these predictions. This calls for wide-area multi-object spectrographs on 12m-class telescopes capable of accurately capturing such data across the full coverage of spiral arms in nearby galaxies.

Abstract: Understanding dense matter under extreme conditions is one of the most fundamental puzzles in modern physics. Complex interactions give rise to emergent, collective phenomena. While nuclear experiments and Earth - based colliders provide valuable insights, much of the quantum chromodynamics phase diagram at high density and low temperature remains accessible only through astrophysical observations of neutron stars, neutron star mergers, and stellar collapse. Astronomical observations thus offer a direct window to the physics on subatomic scales with gravitational waves presenting an especially clean channel. Next-generation gravitational - wave observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, would serve as unparalleled instruments to transform our understanding of neutron star matter. They will enable the detection of up to tens of thousands of binary neutron star and neutron star - black hole mergers per year, a dramatic increase over the few events accessible with current detectors. They will provide an unprecedented precision in probing cold, dense matter during the binary inspiral, exceeding by at least an order of magnitude what current facilities can achieve. Moreover, these observatories will allow us to explore uncharted regimes of dense matter at finite temperatures produced in a subset of neutron star mergers, areas that remain entirely inaccessible to current instruments. Together with multimessenger observations, these measurements will significantly deepen our knowledge of dense nuclear matter.

Abstract: Ultracompact Galactic binaries with orbital periods below an hour are among the strongest persistent gravitational-wave (GW) sources in the mHz band and will constitute the dominant population detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Tens of thousands are predicted to be individually resolved, with a substantial fraction bright enough for electromagnetic (EM) follow-up. This opens an unprecedented multi-messenger window on compact binary evolution, tidal interactions, mass transfer, and the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. We highlight key science enabled by joint GW + EM constraints and emphasize the critical need for rapid, high-cadence spectroscopic capabilities in the 2040s. In particular, the most compact (<10 min) binaries detected by LISA will require read-noise-free, zero-dead-time spectroscopic facilities, potentially realized through coordinated arrays of telescopes with time-staggered exposures, to measure radial velocities, tidal heating signatures, and orbital evolution with the precision needed for transformative multi-messenger studies.

Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are fundamental to cosmology and galactic chemical evolution, yet the nature of their progenitor systems remains unresolved. Multiple evolutionary pathways, including single-degenerate, double-degenerate, and helium-donor systems, are thought to contribute to the SN Ia population, but direct observational constraints are limited. This uncertainty hampers our understanding of SN Ia diversity and introduces systematic uncertainties in their use as precision cosmological probes. By the 2040s, surveys such as Gaia, LSST, SDSS-V, 4MOST, and the gravitational-wave mission LISA will identify thousands of compact binaries in the Milky Way that are potential SN Ia progenitors. However, survey discoveries alone are insufficient. Robust identification and characterization require high-time-resolution, phase-resolved spectroscopy to determine fundamental parameters such as component masses, orbital inclinations, chemical compositions, and accretion states. Addressing these challenges demands new observational capabilities. The most compact binaries require continuous, dead-time-free spectroscopy with negligible readout noise, while the progenitor population spans a wide range of brightness and orbital periods. A modular, multi-aperture telescope array equipped with fast, low-noise spectrographs can flexibly combine collecting area for faint targets, observe bright systems efficiently, and deliver uninterrupted time series through staggered exposures. Such observations are difficult for single-aperture facilities.

Abstract: Large Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations (e.g., Starlink and Iridium) significantly increase the likelihood of transient, high-power interference events at ground receivers. This report presents SatTrack, a GUI-driven simulation framework that (i) tracks satellite motion relative to a fixed antenna boresight, (ii) predicts reflector gain patterns of a parabolic reflector antenna with a reconfigurable rim of specified size using a physical optics (PO) surface-current model decomposed into fixed and reconfigurable rim regions, and (iii) synthesizes deep, directional nulls using fast rim-weight optimization algorithms. Beyond baseline serial greedy and greedy bit-flip methods, additional files support advanced weight optimization algorithms including simulated annealing and majorization-minimization operating over higher-order complex weight alphabets, enabling deeper null formation. Interference power from satellites is estimated using free-space path loss and an FCC-derived Starlink EIRP versus steering-angle model, and event-level throughput for each satellite is computed using Shannon capacity. Results show simple binary rim control achieves about 40-55 dB of average interference suppression, while advanced optimization methods can exceed 65-70 dB under favorable geometries, with best-case received interference below -220 dBm. We compare no mitigation, satellite muting, and rim-based spatial nulling, showing rim-based nulling approaches muting-level suppression while preserving throughput close to the no-mitigation case. These results highlight both the scalability of rim-based reflector reconfiguration and the fundamental limitation when satellites cross the main lobe.

Abstract: In this white paper, we propose an upgrade to the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) consisting of the addition of a new 8m Unit Telescope (UT5). The primary goal of this upgrade is to optimise the VLTI for exoplanet detection by creating four additional baselines of approximately 200m oriented toward the north-west. The inclusion of this telescope would reduce the inner working angle and improve the achievable contrast of the VLTI, thereby enabling the detection of mature exoplanets in reflected light.

Abstract: A deep understanding of the life-cycle of galaxies, particularly those of high mass, requires clarifying the mechanisms that regulate star formation (SF) and its abrupt shutdown (quenching), often capable of stopping SF rates of hundreds of solar masses per year. What initially triggers quenching, and what sustains the quiescent state thereafter, especially given the frequent presence of large gas reservoirs or even massive gas inflows, are unsolved key issues. Ultimately, the crucial connection between the galaxy life-cycle and the surrounding Intergalactic (IGM) and Circumgalactic (CGM) Medium remains largely unclear. Addressing these issues requires studying star formation, chemical enrichment, and quenching homogeneously up to high redshift. The upcoming AO-assisted Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), will deliver sharper and deeper data than the JWST. SHARP is a concept study for a near-IR (0.95-2.45 mu) spectrograph designed to fully exploit the capabilities of ELT. Designed for multi-object slit spectroscopy and multi-Integral Field spectroscopy, SHARP points to achieve angular resolutions (~30 mas) far superior to NIRSpec at JWST(100 mas) to decipher and reconstruct the life-cycle oa galaxies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Underluminous Thermonuclear Supernovae (uTSNe) are an emerging class of transient events that resemble classic Supernovae Type Ia, but peak at much lower luminosities. Suspected to be the deflagrations of white dwarfs, they directly link the final stages of low-mass binary star evolution to extragalactic studies that are critical for cosmology. The ability to detect and study uTSNe is limited by the lack of high spatial resolution (<0.1"), wide-field (>10'x10') imaging capabilities in the optical, as well as large-scale segmented-telescope spectroscopic abilities that allow highly dynamic time-critical spectroscopy of short-duration transient events. Neither capability is currently foreseen for the European Southern Observatory and is therefore an excellent candidate for the Expanding Horizons program.

Abstract: Recent work by Oberti et al, (Astron. Astrophys., 667, 48, 2022) argued and made a compelling case that classical astronomical adaptive optics (AO) tomography performance can be further enhanced by carefully designing and optically configuring the system to leverage inherent super-resolution (SR) capabilities. Our goal here is to further materialise the concept by providing the means to compute SR-enabling tomographic reconstructors for AO and showcase its broad uptake on soon every 10 m-class VIS/NIR telescopes and Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes of up to 40 m in diameter. To that end we indicate the necessary tomography generalisations where we: (i) clarify how model-and-deploy is a generic methodological umbrella for linear minimum-mean-squared-error (LMMSE) tomographic reconstructors arising naturally from the solution of the tomographic inverse problem, thus unifying various solutions presented as distinct in the literature within a single framework, (ii) recall how such solutions are found as limiting cases of a model-based optimal control problem, thus elucidating how pseudo-open-loop control is a feature of the latter that allows LMMSE reconstructors to be adapted to closed-loop systems, (iii) review the two forms of the LMMSE tomographic reconstructors, highlighting the necessary adaptations to accommodate super-resolution, (iv) review the implementation in either dense-format vector-matrix-multiplication or sparse iterative forms and (v) discuss the implications for runtime and off-line real-time implementations, anticipating widespread adoption. We illustrate our examples with physical-optics numerical simulations for 10 m and 40 m-scale systems showing the performance benefits of super-resolution in the order of several tens of nm rms and the computational burden associated.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) refers to a combination of optical design and signal processing techniques jointly employed to obtain reconstructed wave-fronts at a higher-resolution from multiple low-resolution samples, overcoming the intrinsic limitations of the latter. After compelling examples have been provided on multi-Shack-Hartman (SH) wave-front sensor (WFS) adaptive optics systems performing atmospheric tomography with laser guide star probes, we broaden the SR concept to pyramid sensors (PyWFS) with a single sensor and a natural guide star. We revisit the analytic PyWFS diffraction model to claim two aspects: i) that we can reconstruct spatial frequencies beyond the natural Shannon-Nyquist frequency imposed by the detector pixel size and/or ii) that the PyWFS can be used to measure amplitude aberrations (at the origin of scintillation). SR offers the possibility to control a higher actuator density deformable mirror from seemingly fewer samples, the quantification of which is one of the goals of this paper. A super-resolved PyWFS is more resilient to mis-registration, lifts alignment requirements and improves performance (against aliasing and other spurious modes AO systems are poorly sensitive to) with only a factor up to 2 increased real-time computational burden.

Abstract: The MeerKAT Large Area Synoptic Survey (MeerKLASS) collaboration has acquired multiple passes of L-band (856-1712 MHz) scanning observations over a 268 deg$^2$ sky region. This scanning enables efficient, large-area sky surveys by continuously scanning the MeerKAT array back and forth at fixed elevation while recording data at 2 sec intervals, progressively covering the survey region as the Earth rotates. We employ a novel on-the-fly (OTF) interferometric imaging technique to construct continuum images and catalogs from 16 hours of scan data. These data products, constituting the first MeerKLASS L-band data release (DR1), consist of high-fidelity radio continuum images and a catalogue of 34,874 radio sources detected with a SNR$>$9. The resulting Stokes I images achieve a median noise level of 33 $μ$Jy\,beam$^{-1}$ and a median angular resolution of approximately $25.5''\times 7.8''$. Cross-comparisons with previous surveys confirm the consistency of our flux density scale within 5\% and astrometric precision within $1.5''$. Additionally, flux densities measured across the seven sub-bands enable in-band spectral-index estimates for the detected sources, providing insights into their physical properties and the broader source population. We compute the differential source counts, finding good agreement with existing measurements and validating our end-to-end processing. This data release demonstrates the effectiveness of scanning surveys when combined with OTF interferometric imaging. Commensal intensity mapping and interferometric imaging offers a dramatic enhancement of survey science per invested hour of observations and could therefore be an appealing option for next generation facilities like SKA-Mid.

Abstract: Heterodyne interferometry for precision science often comes with an optical phase modulation, for example, for intersatellite clock noise transfer for gravitational wave (GW) detectors in space, exemplified by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The phase modulation potentially causes various noise couplings to the final phase extraction of heterodyne beatnotes by a phasemeter. In this paper, in the format of space-based GW detectors, we establish an analytical framework to systematically search for the coupling of various noises from the heterodyne and modulation frequency bands, which are relatively unexplored so far. In addition to the noise caused by the phase modulation, the high-frequency laser phase noise is also discussed in the same framework. The analytical result is also compared with a numerical experiment to confirm that our framework successfully captures the major noise couplings. We also demonstrate a use case of this study by taking the LISA-like parameters as an example, which enables us to derive requirements on the level of the laser and phase modulation noises in the high frequency regimes.
